  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The present work was undertaken early in 1889, and is an
attempt to describe in detail the products and working of the
Oxford Press in its early days. Though eclipsed by the glories
of the later University Press, the first period, included in this
book, has a natural importance of its own. The Fifteenth and
early Sixteenth Century presses<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> are necessarily of interest, and
when printing became firmly established in 1585 it began to
reflect faithfully the current tendencies of thought and study in
the University. Theology is predominant, animated on its controversial
side with fierce opposition to the Church of Rome, but
the quieter fields of classical work are well represented, and side
by side is seen an increasing study of English literature. Of
lighter books there are few, and of chapbooks perhaps only one
(1603, no. 5).</p>

<p class='c001'>The most important works produced at Oxford between 1585
and 1640 were Richard de Bury’s Philobiblon (1599), Wycliff’s
treatises (1608), capt. John Smith’s Map of Virginia (1612),
Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy (1621, &amp;c.), Field on the
Church (1628, &amp;c.), Sandys’ translations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses
(1633), the University Statutes (1634), Chaucer’s Troilus
and Cressida in English and Latin (1635), Chillingworth’s
Religion of Protestants (1638), and Bacon’s Advancement and
Proficience of Learning, in English (1640: see frontispiece).
There are of course many books on logic, philosophy and the
like, intended for the University curriculum, and many collections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>of the rhetorical poems by which the University was expected
to condole or rejoice with every change in the royal estate. 180
pages of mechanical grief at Elizabeth’s death in 1603 are at once
followed by 200 pages of equally mechanical congratulations to
James I: and the metrical tears dropped in turn on the grave of
the latter monarch in March 1625, are in May succeeded with
indecorous haste by songs of joy on the marriage of his successor.
Some volumes of English poems and plays occur, by Skelton,
Nicholas Breton, Churchyard, Fitz-Geffrey, Randolph, Cartwright,
Fletcher, and others, and a few still lighter pieces, such
as a Masque at Richmond, partly in Wiltshire dialect, and
“Bushell’s Rock,” both in 1636. There are traces of the study
of Spanish, French and Welsh, as well as of Latin and Greek;
and an attempt to introduce phonetic writing and spelling was
made by Charles Butler in 1633 and 1634. Even theological
disputes are lightened by the solemn account of certain Jesuits
in the East, who dressed up a carcase as that of a queen recently
deceased, obtained much glory from the miracles it wrought,
until the real corpse arrived and the priests vacated the vicinity
(1633, Gregorius). There is something surprising in Oxford
being chosen as the printing-place of a book to persuade mothers
to nurse their own children (1622, Clinton); and an episcopal
alchemist is not often to be met with in real life (1621, Thornborough).
It is less to be wondered at that a college which had
leased land to Queen Elizabeth for a quiet five thousand years,
should try to be relieved of its agreement within fifty (1623,
Oxford).</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no need of a general history of the University Press
at this time, as distinguished from the annals which the Appendixes
of this work present. The printers were privileged
members of the University, and occasionally printed “cum
privilegio,” but there is little to invest their personal proceedings
with importance. Though it is true that money was advanced
in 1585 by the Earl of Leicester, Chancellor of the University, to
set up Joseph Barnes with a new press, and that the charter of
privileges in 1632 gave the University direct control of the
printing, there are as yet few signs of actual academical patronage
or interference, and the failures and successes of the printers
and publishers, which can be traced in detail in Appendixes C
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>and F, are the ordinary fluctuations of trade. Nor can the
Oxford press at this time claim much connexion with the greater
world of the English Court or Church. After it was placed on
a permanent footing by the Earl of Leicester, its one great patron
and protector within our period was Archbishop Laud, who
occupied a similar position to that of Bishop Fell at a later
period in the same century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The year 1640 has been chosen as the inferior limit of this
bibliography, partly because both the British Museum Catalogue
of early English books and Arber’s Transcript of the Registers
of the Stationers’ Company stop at that point, partly because
the interest in the products of the press as such was found to be
rapidly diminishing, and partly in consequence of the break-up
of all quiet progress during the convulsions of the Rebellion,
combined with the dismal prospect of that trackless wilderness—the
literature of the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c001'>The present bibliography presents, it is believed, four features
of novelty:—the better representation of the titlepage by the
use of Roman and Italic capitals as well as ordinary type; the
mention of the chief type used in each book; the furnishing of
the first words of certain pages, to facilitate the identification of
imperfect copies; and the insertion of actual pages<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of books
printed at Oxford, selected from works which are cheap and
common. These points are explained and discussed in a paper
on <cite>Method in Bibliography</cite>, printed at pp. 91–106 of vol. 1 of the
Transactions of the Bibliographical Society (1893), to which the
reader is referred, if he wishes to see a fuller account of the
whole aim and method of the present book.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best thanks of the writer are due for general help to
Mr. E. Gordon Duff, Librarian of the John Rylands (late
Spencer) Library at Manchester, to Mr. F. J. H. Jenkinson,
Librarian of the Cambridge University Library, and to Mr. W.
H. Allnutt of the Bodleian: but especially to the Delegates of
the Clarendon Press both for undertaking on liberal terms a work
which can scarcely prove remunerative, and for enabling the
Oxford Historical Society to supply copies to its members, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>vol. xxix, at a price far below its actual cost<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Mr. Horace Hart,
the Controller of the Press, has taken a warm personal interest
in the printing, and any merits of form which may be found are
due to his experience and to the co-operation of his compositors.
Nothing, however, can relieve the writer of responsibility for the
errors and shortcomings which will be detected; and he can only
plead that it is better to bring out an imperfect book, if it is
a useful one and the result of hard work, than, by straining after an
unattainable completeness, to delay indefinitely its publication.</p>

<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Minor Points.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'><i>Dates.</i> The books classed under a given year, such as 1615, are necessarily
such as were issued between 25 March 1615 and 24 March 1616,
since no means exist for dividing them according to the historical year. In
recording a date between Jan. 1 and March 24, the form used is invariably the
double one, such as 23 Feb. 161<span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='ov'>6</span></span>, by which is implied what we understand
by 23 Feb. 1616.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Numbers of books.</i> Some notes on the number of books printed at Oxford
will be found on p. <a href='#Page_291'>291</a>, and of books printed or published at Oxford on
p. <a href='#Page_292'>292</a>, among the Notanda.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>References.</i> The usual style of reference throughout the book (including
index) is to the <i>year</i> followed by the <i>initial letter</i> of the particular heading;
as 1634 C, when the reference is to no. 9 on p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a> (Cosin). A few references
will be found in the earlier pages to years beyond 1640, made before it was
decided to close the work at that year.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Titles.</i> The heading usually presents the author’s name in the form by
which he is generally known to posterity, as “James ii, king,” although at
the time of the book referred to he was prince James.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PLAN OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>15th and early 16th century.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The books of these periods are in some respects exceptionally treated, but the
general plan is similar to that of the later press. Pages <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>–7 (printed off in 1889) must
be taken in close connexion with Appendixes A and B, which correct and supplement
those pages in important points.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1585–1640.</h3>

<p class='c019'>1. After the heading (which in all cases is the author or a body representing the
author, if known; otherwise the catch-title) comes the title, reproduced faithfully so far
as was possible with the employment of four types. A fifth minute type indicates
letters represented by contractions in the original. The occurrence of a “motto”
(whether a text or quotation), a device (see p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>) or woodcuts (see p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>) is noted
in square brackets. A * before the heading implies “undated”: a † “no place of
printing mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c001'>2. Next follows the technical description, comprising:—</p>

<p class='c010'><i>a.</i> The number of the imprint (see pp. <a href='#Page_292'>292</a>–310: it would have been better to
add the names of the printer and publisher to the bare reference).</p>

<p class='c010'><i>b.</i> The date.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>c.</i> The apparent size of a page of an ordinary uncut copy, according to the scale,</p>

<p class='c010'>The number of leaves in a section (quire or gathering) precedes, within round
brackets, when different from what is suggested by the apparent size: as “(eights)
small 4<sup>o</sup>.” When it has been desirable to indicate further the way in which the
original sheets of paper have been folded, the words <i>single</i>, <i>double</i>, or <i>treble</i> (for once,
twice, or thrice folded) are used on p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>d.</i> The number of pages of a perfect copy, in square brackets when there is no
printed pagination, as “pp. [16] + 121 + [9].” When printed pagination does not occur
in the book at all, the signatures are also given.</p>

edited by Bliss (1813–20), has been considered as superseding in most instances any
biographical account of the author. And the limitation of the present work to a
bibliography of a press, not of books connected with the University, has been borne in
mind.</p>

<p class='c019'>A small sheet of paper printed on the ice-bound Thames at London
18 Jan. 1716 ascribes to Oxford the first printing in England, in the
year 1459. Most of the information on the sheet is derived from
Atkyns’s <cite>Original and Growth of Printing</cite> (Lond. 1664).</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1461.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Printing was “practised in Oxford in 1461,” according to Randle
Holmes’s <cite>Academy of Armory</cite> (Chester, 1688), quoted in Bigmore,
i. 337.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1469–70.</h3>

<p class='c019'>In Herbert’s Ames, iii. 1393 we read:—“In the late Tho. Osborne’s
catalogue of books for sale in June 1756, No. 1345 ‘Plinii Secundi
Epistolarum, Liber primus. Exemplar elegans, literis initial. colorat.
corio turcico, fol. deaur. lineis rubris &amp; auro elegans ornat. 15l. 15s.
Oxon. apud F. Corsellis. 1469.’ To which is added this note, ‘Hocce
unicum est exemplar notum, a variis allegatum, et vix uni visum adeo ut
Phoenix librorum dici mereratur [<i>sic</i>], certe primus est ex libris a Corcellis
impressis, cui nomen suum adjunxerit, secundus vero ordine
omnium quos unquam ille impressit, priorem scilicet scimus fuisse,
Jeronymi Expositionem in Symbol. Apostol. Oxoniae 1468. Anno
1470, varia idem typographus impressit Opuscula, addito in fine nomine,
sed nec unicum eorum reperitur hodie integrum. Possident quidam
amatores fragmenta aliqua poematum Latinorum, ut Gerardi Lystrii
Rhenensis, &amp;c. Carmen Listrii lividorum hominum venenosas linguas,
&amp;c.’ This raised the curiosity of the book collectors, who considered
this article as a confirmation of what R. Atkins had asserted about
printing at Oxford. They all flocked to Osborne’s shop, who instead
of the book, produced a letter from a man at Amsterdam, filled with
frivolous excuses for not sending them to him. They were disappointed,
and looked on the whole as a <span class='sc'>Hvm</span>; however the Plinii Epistolæ, and
Ger. Listrii Oratio, &amp;c. afterwards appeared at an auction at Amsterdam,
and were bought for the late Dr. Ant. Askew; and were sold again at an
auction of his books, by Baker and Leigh, in Feb. 1775. Lot 2064, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>2622, to which articles are annexed, viz. to Lot 2064, ‘Ad finem hæc
verba, <i>Impr. Oxon. apud F. Corsellis</i>, 1470, Manu recentiore exarata
sunt.’ Also to lot 2622, ‘Hæc verba, <i>Imprim. Oxon. ap. Corsellis</i>, 1469,
Manu recentiore exarata sunt.’ To those who are at all conversant in
early printing, the dates will appear at first sight a bungling forgery.”
So far Herbert’s Ames, cf. Bowyer and Nichols’s <cite>Origin of Printing</cite>,

<p class='c001'>In the <cite>Monthly Miscellany, or Memoirs for the Curious</cite> (June 1708),
p. 177 it is stated that in the Bishop of Ely’s Library (now at Cambridge)
are books “of the first printing in England at Oxford in 1469.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1480.</h3>

<p class='c019'>“Guido de Columnia de historia Trojana, per T. R. (<i>Theodore Rood</i>).
Quarto. 1480.” So Herbert’s Ames, p. 1393. The source of the error
was discovered by Cotton to be a forgery in a copy of Guido sine anno
et loco preserved in the Earl of Pembroke’s Library at Wilton (<cite>Typ. Gaz.</cite>,
1st ser., 2nd ed., p. 209.)</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Before 1487.</h3>

<p class='c019'>“Books from the Oxford Press.... 208*. The Chronicles of England.
Folio. Lent by the Earl of Jersey.” So in the Catalogue of the Caxton
Celebration, 1877, p. 28. Some error. The reference is no doubt to
Caxton’s Chronicle of England, printed in 1482.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1489.</h3>

<p class='c019'>When Cotton printed his <cite>Typographical Gazetteer</cite>, 2nd series, (Oxf.
1866) he believed that an Indulgence of 1489 (altered to 1499), in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Library of Trinity College, Dublin, was printed at Oxford. It is “a
small broadside on vellum, consisting of 24 lines only, printed very
closely and occupying a space of about nine inches by six.” The Indulgence
is from Johannes de Gigliis alias de Liliis Apostolicus Subdiaconus,
granted by Pope Innocent iii: and is dated 1499, there being
no name of place or date of printing. There is no doubt that Cotton
was mistaken in attributing this piece to the Oxford press.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1498.</h3>

<p class='c019'>1. Bagford, in his inaccurate way, gives the title of an edition of the
Greek text of the Ethics of Aristotle by Aretinus “Oxon. 1498” (Brit.
Mus. MS. Harl. 5901, fol. 3). He mentions the 1479 edition of the
Latin text separately, but the former date can only be due to some
confusion with the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The Rufinus of 1468 appears as dated 1498 in Panzer, who quotes
Schoenemann i. 585, and also in Migne’s <cite>Patrologia Latina</cite>, xxi. col. 17.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>1499.</h3>

<p class='c006'>2. “Gualtheri Burley Tractatus de materia et forma ac de relativis.
Oxonii 1500. 4.” So in Panzer ii (1794) p. 244, quoting Maittaire p.
739, ex Bibl. Bodl. p. 117 (an allusion to an error in the Bodleian
Catalogue of 1674, repeated in the 1738 Catalogue p. 206). Bagford
makes the same mistake, twisting the author’s name into Johannes
Buridanus (Brit. Mus. MS. Harl. 5901, fol. 3). Even Hain (no. 4142)
has copied from Panzer. The colophon of 1518. B shows how the error
arose, as Cotton points out (<cite>Typ. Gaz.</cite>, 1st ser., 2nd ed., p. 209).</p>

<p class='c006'>3, 4. Bagford is responsible for two more fictitious Oxford books of
1500. a <cite>Quaestiones de lumine et luce</cite> (Brit. Mus. MS. Harl. 5901, fol. 3,
Bodl. MS. Rawl. D. 375, fol. 103: a confusion with 1518. L) and a
Whitinton <i>de heteroclytis nominibus</i> printed at Oxford by Peter Treveris (!)
(Bodl. MS. Rawl. D. 375, fol. 103: see 1518. W).</p>

<p class='c019'>The following book though not printed at Oxford supplies information

a 5th treatise, ending with a letter from Peregrinus de Lugo dated

Ames iii. 1396, and Panzer vii. p. 494, quoting Brüggemann i. 172.
The source of the mistake is easily found in the colophon of 1517. B,
a “v” having been overlooked. The error is repeated in the <cite>Bookworm</cite>
(1868) p. 126.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Before 1519.</h3>

<p class='c019'>According to Cotton (<cite>Typ. Gaz.</cite>, 2nd ser., p. 169) an edition of “Jo.
Duns Scotus, Scriptum Oxoniense super primum Sententiarum” (Paris

cannot be correct, unless <i>editio</i> refers only to some traditional method of

<p class='c010'>For the author &amp;c. see Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite> ii. 169: where it is pointed out that
the book has a curious history. Its ostensible purpose is to uphold the doctrine afterwards
called “passive obedience” by refuting two books which were regarded as subversive
of the Queen’s temporal power, (1) <cite>An apologie and true declaration of the institution ...
of the tvvo English colleges ... in Rome ... (and) in Rhemes</cite>, 1581 (ascribed
to card. Will. Allen), (2) <cite>A true, sincere and modest defence of English catholiques that
suffer for their faith</cite>, n. d. (asserted by Antony à Wood to be also by card. Allen).
But Wood declares that the Queen “conceiving it convenient for her worldly designs
to take on her the protection of the Low-Countries against the King of Spain, did
employ our author ... to write the said book” to <i>justify</i> the Netherland revolt. And
certain it is that in consequence of the temperance and fairness with which Bp. Bilson
treats his subject, the parliamentary party in Charles I’s time used this book to <i>oppose</i>
“passive obedience.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The first book printed at the new Oxford press. The allusions to this and kindred
facts are (1) in the “Epistola Nuncupatoria.” Case says of the reasons for dedicating
the work to the Earl of Leicester “Unum est nouum hoc præli beneficium, quod te
authore nostra Academia nuper recepit ... Prælum hoc nouum (cuius author existis)
hunc nouum de moribus libellum pressit. Ne ergo author libelli præli authori videatur
ingratus, tibi primùm eiusdem fructum ex animo propinauit ...” (2) the printer himself
writes “Admirabilem hanc artem typographicam (Mecęnas amplissime) primum Iohannes
Faustus Moguntiæ fauste genuit [the marg. supplies “Anno 1450”], eandem Guilielmus
Caxtonus ciuis Londinensis probè aluit &amp; perpoliuit: Laus summa debetur authori qui
invenit, laus magna debetur mercatori qui primùm ad nos transuexit ... Londinum diù in
hac arte floruit, &amp; non inuideo: Cantabrigia eandem nunc didicit, Oxonia recepit, &amp;
certè gaudeo. Nam si characteres typographi sint vera insignia &amp; arma Mineruæ; vbi
terrarum potius floreret hæc nobilis scientia, quàm vbi vera publicè docetur sapientia?
vt enim à fonte in riuum dulcis aqua, ita hîc quidem à mente in prælum dulcissima
Musa fluet. Non nugæ, non aniles fabulæ, non Aristarchi dentata opera hîc excudentur:
ea solùm ex his prælis in lucem venient quȩ sapientum calculis approbentur,
&amp; Sybillȩ foliis sint veriora. Hoc vnum nunc restat (vir inclytissime) vt hunc librum
opus alterius ingenij &amp; pignus laboris mei tuo honori offeram ... Vt ergo Thomas
Thomasius collega meus [Cantabrigiensis] suo, ita ego Iosephus Barnesius tibi (vir
summe) meo patrono dominoque gratulor: nos ambo &amp; publico pro multis, &amp; priuato
nomine pro magnis in nos meritis vobis vtriusque Academiæ patronis deuincti sumus,
gratias immortales vterque agimus, maiores in posterum pollicemur”: (3) the Vice-chancellor,
J. Underhill, writes “Non dedit hoc seclo prælum Oxoniense priorem [librum]
| Doctrinâque dabunt secula nulla parem.” (4) Laurence Humfrey says “Hoc Speculum
vobis nunc Oxoniensis alumnus | Porrigit, en præli dat quoque primitias.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is clear that neither the Vice-chancellor nor the printer of this volume had any
suspicion that there had been printing in Oxford previous to the publication of the
present volume, unless “recepit” be a vague allusion to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work is a companion one to the same author’s <cite>Summa veterum interpretum in
universam dialecticam Aristotelis</cite>, Lond., Tho. Vautrollerius, 1584, see 1592. C, 1598.
C: and there is even a typographical connexion between the two.</p>

<p class='c010'>For an account of the author, see Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, i. 685. The method adopted
by Case is by <i>quaestiones</i>, <i>oppositiones</i> and <i>responsiones</i> in the manner of the disputations
in the schools at the time. Other editions were issued at Oxford in 1596, and at
Frankfurt in 1589, 1610 and 1625. See 1596. C.</p>

and the improbability that the Committee of Convocation appointed to consider

[misprinted 439], the work, in 2 parts:
(1) title of Bunny’s treatise: 1–140, the
treatise: before p. 1 of the treatise is an
oblong sheet 5 × 11 in., folded, containing
on one side in two divisions “A table
... of the treatise following”: on p. 140
is also a colophon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of this book also there is a curious history. Gaspare Loarte, a Spanish Jesuit who
spent most of his life at Rome, wrote an “Essercitio della vita christiana” some time
before 1569. In 1570, J. Sancer, a friend of Robert Parsons the Jesuit, published a
translation into English of one of the three parts of the work. In 1582 Parsons himself
published “The firste booke of the Christian Exercise, appertayning to resolution”
in two parts, which is practically a new work based on part of the original “Essercitio.”
Loarte is mentioned in the preface, but the author only signs his name by the initials,
R. P. This was again issued without Parsons’ knowledge in 1584.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1585 (or according to Wood and Ames, copied by Herbert and Dibdin, in 1584)
Edmund Bunny printed and published the first edition of an adaptation of Parsons’
book fitted for Protestant readers “at London, by N. Newton, for Iohn Wight,” 8<sup>o</sup>.
The dedication is to the archbp. of York and the preface dated 9 July 1584 at Bolton-Percy.
The book was entered at Stationers’ Hall on 28 Aug. 1584. The Oxford
edition before us is a reprint of this London edition with no intentional variation,
except the omission of the arms of the archbishop of York on the <i>verso</i> of the title of
the London issue. Some of the woodcut ornaments and capitals of the two issues are
identical.</p>

<p class='c010'>In “1585, Aug. 30” Parsons again put out his book in a revised and largely
augmented form with a new title “A Christian Directorie” which when complete was
to consist of three books, the first of which, treating of Resolution, is alone contained
in this edition. The preface contains a criticism of the London issue of Bunny’s
adaptation, which provoked “A briefe answer vnto those idle and friuolous quarrels
of R. P. against the late edition of the Resolution: By Edmund Bunny.” Lond.,
1589, 8<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other editions of Bunny’s adaptation of Parsons’ “Christian exercise” are 1586
(Lond., “by I. Iackson and Ed. Bollifant for John Wight,” 12<sup>o</sup>; in Herbert’s possession),
1589 (Lond., 12<sup>o</sup>: Bohn), 1594 (Lond., 24<sup>o</sup>: Bohn), 1609 (Lond., 12<sup>o</sup>: Bohn),
1615 (Lond., 12<sup>o</sup>). See also next art. Parsons’ own work was several times reprinted:
and in 1591 appeared an edition of his “Christian Directorie,” anonymously
adapted, as the former work, for the use of Protestants, and with the deceptive title
“The second part of the booke of Christian Exercise, appertayning to Resolution, or
a Christian directorie ... written by the former authour R. P.” (Lond., 12<sup>o</sup>). This
was several times reprinted, as in 1592, 1594, 1598, 1615. See also Wood’s <cite>Ath.

Oxford, 8 Mar. 1586, signed “T. P.”:
(8–16) “To the Christian reader ...”
with the writer’s name, Th. Pie: 1–219,
the paraphrase, the text of Ecclesiastes
occurring in the margin.</p>

<p class='c010'>This book is a translation into English of “Sapientissimi regis Salomonis concio
de summo hominis bono quam ... Latini Ecclesiasten vocant, in Latinam linguam ab
Antonio Corrano ... versa et ex eiusdem prælectionibus paraphrasi illustrata: accesserunt
&amp; notæ quædam” (Lond., 1579) with the omission of the notes. For Ant. de
Corro see Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, i. 578: and for Thomas Pye, <i>ibid.</i> ii. 59. Wood was
not acquainted with this earliest work of Pye, but alludes to the book (as above, i. 581)
as Corro’s “Sermons on Ecclesiastes. Abridged by Thomas Pitt. Oxon 1585, oct.,
which is called by some Pitt’s Paraphrase on Ecclesiastes”! The name Pitt, but not
the error of date, may be taken from Maunsell, who three times (i. 38, 81, 104) alludes
to the book as by Tho. Pitt. Pye in his Epistle states with respect to the original
Latin edition, “which treatise, as it came first to the print, myselfe by occasion being
charged with som ouerseeing of the presse, at the earnest request aswel of the author
himself, as of other many, I translated into English: being the rather a greate deale
moued thereunto, because there was no comment or like exposition then extant in our
vulgar tongue vpon this part of Scripture.” This latter statement is not strictly true,
since “An exposition of Salomon’s booke called Ecclesiastes” was printed in
London in 1573. In 1585 Serranus’s commentary translated into English by T.
Wilcocke was printed in London.</p>

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, i. 135. This work is an imaginary reply of Hippolytus to
the temptations of Phaedra, in Ovidian elegiacs. The author, John Shepery, of Corpus
Christi College (“Somatochristianus”), tells us in the preface that it was composed
as a return for kindness shown him by one Guadus (Wade ?, whom the editor describes
as a chaplain to Henry viii), but delayed for some years. Shepery died in 1542,
aged 32 years. George Etheridge (“Edrychus”) was a pupil of Shepery, fellow of
Corpus, and a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p class='c010'>The date is fixed at 1586 by two passages: Etheridge in his preface states that
for about 53 years he had been a member of the University: he was admitted scholar
of Corpus in Nov. 1534. Also Dr. Humphrey in his introduction to the <cite>Summa et
synopsis</cite> (see below) alludes to the <cite>Hippolytus</cite> as “nuperrime impressum.” Wood
places the date at about 1584, and the Bodleian catalogue of 1843 assigns the book
to 1542, owing to the date of Shepery’s death, which happens to occur prominently
at the end of Etheridge’s preface.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “Summa Ioannis Sheprevi” is a set of elegiac stanzas, each stanza describing
the contents of a chapter in the New Testament, and beginning successively with the
letters of the alphabet, written by John Shepery, of Corpus Christi College, Reader of
the Hebrew Lecture from about 1537 to his death in 1542. The <cite>Summa</cite> is stated by
Wood to have been first published at Strasburg in about 1556 by John Parkhurst bp.
of Norwich, next in Lond. 1560 (Wood), and from Humfrey’s ed. in “Gemma Fabri,”
Lond. 1598, and “Biblii (or Bibliorum) summula,” Lond. 1621, etc. The first distich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>is “A priscis oritur Christus, turbatur Ioseph, | Angelus hunc retinet, virgo beata
parit.” MS. C. C. C. (Oxf.) 266 contains these verses.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “Synopsis” is a similar set of elegiac stanzas, without the alphabetical succession
of first letters, first inserted in the Latin editions of Erasmus’s New Testament,
from that of 1542 on. The author appears to be unknown: the first distich is
“Angelus in somnis iustum solatur Ioseph, | Prototoco Mariæ nomen Iesus erit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the preface Dr. Humfrey states that his object in editing the book was to recall
young students to the study of the text of the Bible, and that he had collated a MS.
copy of the <cite>Summa</cite> with bp. Parkhurst’s edition, and had compared different editions of
the <cite>Synopsis</cite>: he alludes also to the Hippolytus of Shepery as “nuperrime impressum.”</p>

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, i. 135, 560. Dr. Philip Bliss noted in his copy “Whoever
wants to write a history of the Oxford press should first get together all the little vols
printed by Jo. Barnes, of which this is one of the rarest.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ii. 138. The best account of this work will be extracts
from the Epistle dedicatory. John Harmar the translator was in this year Proctor,
Regius professor of Greek and Fellow of New College. He says, “I was requested,
right honorable, by manie of my friends to emploie the time of this last vacation of
mine from my publique readinges in the Vniuersitie, in the translating of Master
Bezaes Sermons vpon the Canticle of Canticles, which I had a little before receaued
from the Francfurt mart in French, into our vulgare and Mother tongue.” The
patronage of Lord Dudley is acknowledged and details of the translator’s life are given,
as that he attended Beza’s lectures and sermons at Geneva. The work translated was
no doubt Beza’s “Sermons sur les trois premiers chapitres du Cantique des cantiques

<p class='c010'>This anonymous treatise is a formal and precise legal argument on the question
“Utrum legatus alicuius principis absoluti vel ipse princeps absolutus morte sit afficiendus,
si in aliena republica, contra vitam principis vel salutem totius reipublicae, nefariam
coniurationem fuerint machinati.” It was intended to support Queen Elizabeth
in her resolution to execute Mary Queen of Scots, and seems to have been written
after 4 Dec. 1586 (p. 13) and before the execution 8 Feb. 1587: but there is no clue
to the author.</p>

<p class='c010'>The author’s name nowhere occurs, but there can be but little doubt that
the volume was written by John Penry of St. Alban hall, Oxford (B.A. 1586),
who is conspicuous in the Marprelate controversy and who published <cite>An exhortation
vnto the Gouernours and people of Wales, to labour earnestly to haue the preaching of
the Gospell planted among them</cite> (n. pl. or d., and n. pl. 1588): and also <cite>A View of
... publike wants &amp; disorders ... in the service of God ... within Wales</cite>, n. pl. 1588.
The author says, p. 63, “Some rumor of the speedy dissolution of the Parliament
enforced me from the 32 Pag. or there abouts (so much being already vnder the presse)
to cut off more of the booke by two parts than is now in the whole.” Parliament sat
in 1586 from 28 Oct. to 2 Dec. and not during 1587. At pp. 53–4 Penry alludes to the
state of the Universities. Wood does not know of this work, and the best account of
the author is in Cooper’s <cite>Athenæ Cantabr.</cite>, ii. 154.</p>

Rider claims that the Dictionarie is the first “that hath the English before the Latine,
with a ful Index of al such latine words as are in any one common Dictionarie” and
that it has 4000 more words than any other. He acknowledges the pecuniary help of
the earl of Sussex and Will. Waade. The book is a “retort courteous” to the Cambridge

The last compartment represents the author in effigy on a tomb with the words “Casus
in occasum vergit vivitque sepultus.” The whole tone of the prefaces is pathetic, Case
feeling that he was close to his end, which actually came on 23 Jan. 1599/1600. At p. (7)
is a reference to the new Bodleian: at (p. 11) it is stated that some German friends
with those at Oxford offered to pay the expense of printing the book rather than that
it should not be printed at all, and that the author carefully revised and pruned it five
times before publication. In an epilogue to the first book (p. 170), dated 25 June
1597, Case apologises to a friend for not giving the <i>text</i> of each book and for not
printing his discourse on Philosophy in general. See the <cite>Ancilla philosophiae</cite>, above.</p>

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, i. 678. Lomazzo’s <cite>Trattato dell’ arte de la pittura</cite> was
published at Milan in 1584, and Haydocke’s Preface gives an account of its rarity in
England. Only five out of the seven books of the original are here published. In the
dedication the translator alludes to Bodley’s design of “erecting and restoring of this
worthie Panbiblion or Temple of all the Muses,” the Bodleian.</p>

<p class='c010'>The title is an elaborate engraving on metal, the words on an oval in the centre: at
top “IO: PAOLO LOMAZZO:” surrounding his bust: on either side Juno and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Apollo (?): on either side the oval, the arms of the University and of New College:
below, in the centre a bust of the translator surmounted by his arms, between figures
derived from classical mythology. In the book are thirteen full-page engravings
marked A-I, K-N, and a profusion of woodcut ornaments. On the last page but
one occurs the large device of the University arms, within a border: then the colophon:
then a woodcut of the arms of New College between two Ws (William of Wykeham).
By some confusion this book is dated 1605 by Bagford (Brit. Mus. MS. Harl. 5901,
fol. 66).</p>

<p class='c010'>Rare. See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ii. 466. This is the first English edition of the
first book on the love of books. The <i>editio princeps</i> is that of 1473 printed at Cologne:
the next Spires, 1483 and Paris 1500. An account of these editions and of the known
MSS. of the <cite>Philobiblon</cite> will be found in E. C. Thomas’s edition (Lond., 1888). The
mysterious “<i>B. P. N.</i>” on the titlepage (followed by “Non quæro quod mihi vtile est,
sed quod multis”) is explained by him as perhaps “Bibliothecae Praefectus Novae”
or “Nostrae” or rather “Bono Publico Natus:” it has been suggested that they may
stand for “Beati Pauli Norma,” alluding to 1 Cor. x. 33. The Editor explains that
it was intended that the work should be followed by an Appendix containing a catalogue
of all MSS. at Oxford, a purpose which seriously delayed the issue of the book.
In fact the whole of the text of the <cite>Philobiblon</cite> was printed off in 1598, as is proved
by a single copy still preserved in the Bodleian dated in that year but containing only
the titlepage, (identical in type with the published one, except in one figure of the
date) and pp. 1 to 62 + [2 blank]. As it is, the Appendix only contains an alphabetical
list, without references, of the authors of which manuscripts were preserved at
Oxford: the intended catalogue appears in the <cite>Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrigiensis</cite>, Lond.,
1600. The preface alludes to the founding of the Bodleian, but dr. James had not yet
been appointed Librarian. There is no sufficient ground for supposing with mr.
Thomas (<i>ut supra</i>, p. lv) and mr. Macray (<cite>Annals of the Bodleian</cite>, 2nd ed., p. 25)
that the single advance copy of 1598 implies an issue or edition of that year.</p>

1605: so that statement has been accepted. Otherwise it would seem that the two

Each leaf bears an engraving of the arms of the University or a College, and a short
Latin poem following. The title appears to indicate the struggle of king James and
England against Italian wiles, the words being from Virg. Aen. i. 72, where the context
bears a different meaning. The dedication shows that the poems were written in 1606.

Bliss’s MS. additions in his own copy of the <cite>Athenæ</cite> in the Bodleian. The coincidence
of initials with Richard Smith in the 1634 edition seems to be accidental. See next
art.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. ——. [Another issue, almost identical in appearance, but entirely
reprinted: easy tests of the two issues are such as (1) on the titlepage
of this second issue, if it be the second, the fourth line begins immediately
under the beginning of the third line, whereas in the first
issue it begins an <i>em</i> to the right: (2) the O of the imprint is upside
down in the first issue: (3) in the title of the author’s Epistle the
second issue has “Anne”, the first “Ann”: (4) p. 41 l. 6 of text, the
first issue has “Enuy”, the second “Envy”: (5) p. 121 l. 1 of text, the
first issue ends with “God”, the second with “God is.” But it is
difficult to say which is a reprint of the other: the second issue is more
modern in spelling and type, and the woodcut ornaments are possibly
less worn in the first. In fact it is conceivable that the second issue is
in reality a few years later.]</p>

“An liceat marito uxorem verberare” was one of those selected for the degree of
D.C.L., 11 July 1608, but Gager was neither inceptor nor respondent. The lady

There are three Idylls, “Amyntas,” “Tityrus,” and “Daphnis,” in Latin hexameter

<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div>[Preface to part 1].</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The first part of this Work is evidently an expanded and revised text of that “Mappe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of the Bay and Rivers, with an annexed Relation of the Countries and Nations that
inhabit them” (p. 444), which President <span class='sc'>John Smith</span> sent home, about November
1608, to the Council in London, as the result of his explorations in Chesapeake Bay in
the previous summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>That this book of travels &amp;c. should have been printed at the Oxford University
Press is a most singular fact....</p>

<p class='c010'>The hand printing presses in England were jealously registered, and locked up every
night, to prevent surrepti[ti]ous printing; all through the lifetime of our Author: and
the Company of Stationers of London especially watched with a keen jealousy the
printing operations of the two Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, who each possessed
a single hand press. See <span class='sc'>W. Herbert’s</span> edition of <span class='sc'>J. Ames’s</span> <cite>Typographical
Antiquities</cite>, iii, 1398, Ed. 1790, 4to.</p>

<p class='c010'>This solitary hand printing press at Oxford, usually produced sermons, theological
and learned Works, &amp;c.; in the midst of which, this book of travels crops up in a
startling manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why could not, or would not <span class='sc'>Smith</span> get it printed in London? Had the revision of
its second Part by the Rev. <span class='sc'>Dr. Simmonds</span> anything to do with the printing at Oxford?
These nuts we must leave for others to crack.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course, being printed at Oxford, this book was not registered at Stationer’s Hall,
London ...</p>

<p class='c010'>It is sometimes misnamed the Oxford <i>tract</i>; but it is rather a book than a tract.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>T. Abbay</span> states, ... [in his preface] respecting this second Part,</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Neither am I the author, for they are many, whose particular discourses are signed

men, and can partly well witnesse their relations true) I could do no lesse in charity to
the world then reveale; nor in conscience, but approve.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>This Part is therefore the Vindication or Manifesto of the thirty or forty Gentlemen
and Soldiers, who, under <span class='sc'>Smith</span>, saved the Colony ...</p>

<p class='c010'>Extremely rare. This book has never been found except in fragments, and usually
in the bindings of books. The Bodleian copy is complete: Merton college, Oxford,
has nearly a complete one from its bindings: the British Museum copy was dr.
Bandinel’s (Sale Catal., Aug. 1861, no. 44), and contains the first 16 (?) pages. Other
fragments are known to exist, chiefly in Oxford college library bindings. The poem

<p class='c010'>It seems on the whole probable that this William Basse, who was a retainer in sir
R. Wenman’s house (Thame Park), is identical with the William Bas who wrote <cite>Sword
and Buckler</cite> (Lond. 1602, 4<sup>o</sup>), which is a poetical defence of Serving-men against the
scorn of their superiors. In Stanza 2 of the present poem is a clear reference to
Bas’s <cite>Three Pastoral Elegies</cite> (Lond. 1602, 4<sup>o</sup>) in the following terms:—“Not (like
as when some triviall discontents | First taught my raw and lucklesse youth to rue |
Doe I to Flockes, now vtter my laments ...”. On the other hand the author of
the <cite>Sword and Buckler</cite> had two sons, whereas here he speaks of his “young Muse.”
Other poems by “William Basse” (Bas) prepared for the press in 1653 were printed
by J. P. Collier in 1870; and contributions to the <cite>Annalia Dubrensia</cite> (1636) and
Walton’s <cite>Angler</cite>, as well as an “Epitaph upon Shakespeare” are mentioned.</p>

as living at Moreton near Thame, in Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, iv. 222.</p>

<p class='c010'>The subject of the first poem is Prince Henry’s death, and of the “Morning” the

but that the author of <cite>Linsi-Woolsie</cite> was of Jesus, matriculated May 18. 1604, a

Mark Pattison’s <cite>Isaac Casaubon</cite> (Lond., 1875: a work without an index), pp. 332,
347, 353, 410, esp. 438–443. Briefly, Casaubon’s “... ad Frontonem Ducæum
[Fronto Le Duc] ... Epistola ... (Lond. 1611) was a defence of the execution of
Henry Garnett in 1606, against some Jesuit books; a reply was published at Cologne
in 1613 by Andreas Eudaemon-Johannes (L’Heureux) “... Epistola ad Amicum
Gallum ... item Responsio ad Epistolam Isaaci Casauboni”, the Responsio being dated
1612 on a separate titlepage. Then Prideaux was selected to answer the <cite>Responsio</cite>,
in order to relieve Casaubon of the task: at p. 224 he quotes Casaubon’s account of
his father’s last days. There is no real ground for Pattison’s remark that “few copies
of Prideaux’s pamphlet survive” (<i>ut supra</i>, p. 443).</p>

funeral oration was first printed in 1607, see 1607 (Wake, 2nd ed.). From a bibliographical
point of view there is great confusion in this and the two subsequent editions
of Rainolds’s Orations (<i>Lond.</i> 1610, and <i>Lond.</i> 1628). For instance Wood himself in
his remarks about Henry Jackson has confused the London edd. (B. C.) with the
Oxford one (A).</p>

a Frenchman by birth: but he was of Magdalen and so not very likely to dedicate
his first work to the head of another college. The collocation of this work and
another translation of Mornay (1612 <span class='fss'>M</span>) in a Bodleian volume suggest the possibility
of the same person being translator of both.</p>

but neither wrote a special treatise on eyesight. The preface is no doubt
by John Barnes and alludes to the worth and undeserved obscurity of Bailey’s work.
The whole book with the possible exception of the titlepage, was printed in London,
the woodcuts being quite unknown at Oxford. Even the arms of the University on
the titlepage are re-cut on wood. The first treatise is only a reprint, Dr. Bailey

of the numberless quotations are perhaps only to be found in the Bodleian, to which
Burton bequeathed his printed books, of which a catalogue is among the Bodleian

Conclusion, is accounted rare, but copies not infrequently appear for sale. Each successive

(Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ii. 384 <i>n.</i>). The authorship has been ascribed to Thomas Lodge

David Pareus, to the effect that subjects may take up arms against their sovereign.
The propositions and censures were considered in a Convocation 25 June 1622. The

which James probably saw to be unpractical), with the addition of comments, written
in senile style but obviously by dr. James, and of great interest both for the biography
of the author and the principles of criticism as applied to editing a text from MSS.
These 26 “Theses or Rules concerning the Art Criticke” are, at p. 23, followed by
examples. Dr. James paid two Dutchmen for transcription abroad at the rate of 20<i>s.</i>
per quire, each quire taking them a week, and the hundred quires per year sufficing to
keep two presses at work (p. 17). At p. 26 he explains that a critical remark by
bp. Bilson first set him about compiling the <cite>Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrigiensis</cite> (Lond.

<p class='c010'>Very rare. This is a curious production of a Dutch press, and appears to be a
vigorous defence of Barneveldt (<i>d.</i> 1619) and the Arminians against Maurice prince
of Orange and the Gomarists. Latin, French, Dutch and Italian are used, and the
whole piece abounds with lacunae. “Walter Map” in the imprint is of course the well-known

published An Examination ... 1626. 4<sup>to</sup>. Ded. to the Master Wardens and Assistants

contain the above dedication, the signatures of the preliminary matter being, on each
leaf:—(blank), *2, **, (blank), forming one gathering of 4 leaves of a natural kind,
though the double asterisk is odd. The original French bore the title “Traicté
auquel sont examinez les preiugez de ceux de l’Eglise Romaine. Contre la Religion
Reformee” (La Rochelle, 1617.) Cameron was a Scotchman, minister at Bordeaux
and Professor of Theology at Saumur. The address to the reader apologises for using
the word <i>prejudice</i> as a translation of the French <i>Preiugé</i>, which means a preconceit
either good or bad: and says “I have not construed but translated.”</p>

curious about the printing of this volume: the pagination is peculiar, and sign. K 1<sup>r</sup>
(p. “31”) has the running title of sermon 4 instead of 5: also the catchword on

to be a verbatim reprint. The signatures of this first ed. begin again with the second

<p class='c010'>See 1628 V: the printer confesses that this is an unauthorized reprint of the original
edition, in consequence of the daily complaint of the rarity of the book: and says
“Nactus itaque tandem amicorum ope istarum Thesium fasciculum (integrum vti
spero,) ... sumpsi mihi fiduciam eum iterùm typis meis exprimendi”. There is
nothing in this to indicate that this is a reissue of the sheets of 1628 V, without even
correction of the misprints: on the contrary the list of errata given in 1628 is omitted.
The first eight pages only are printing of 1631. This edition appears to be quite rare,
but perhaps only accidentally so, because copies have not found their way into public
libraries; or possibly Vossius may have succeeded in stopping a pirated issue.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the author, see Wood’s <cite>Fasti Oxon.</cite>, i. 350. The proof of authorship is not
clear, but the fact seems generally accepted, and Walkington was certainly a Fellow of
St. John’s College, Cambridge. The book has also been attributed to Tho. Wilbie
and T. Wombwell, according to Bohn’s Lowndes. This is a reprint of the 1607 London
edition, re-printed at London in 1639 and 1663. Hitherto this Oxford edition has
been generally regarded as the first, and the British Museum catalogue assigns it
doubtfully to 1605. But it cannot be earlier than 1627 from the woodcuts used, and
in that year first William Turner printed books by himself. And it cannot be later
than 2 Aug. 1638 when Michael Sparke assigned this book to John Dawson with one
of 1631 and one not earlier than 1631. Again, a comparison of 20 imprints of Michael
Sparke between 1627 and 1638 raises a presumption that he did not use the expression
“are to be sold by Michael Sparke at (or, dwelling at) the Blue Bible in Green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Arbour” (nor was he connected with Oxford printers) until 1632, and he uses no local
description of the kind at all in his imprints till 1629. On the whole 1631 is a probable
year for the issue of this book, and 1631–33 more likely than any earlier or later
date.</p>

<p class='c010'>The engraved title on steel (size of plate 5½ × 3½ in.) does not occur in the 1607 ed.
and was doubtless made for this occasion: it was altered in the imprint and then used
again in 1639 and 1663. On either side of the title is a graduate in cap and gown
representing “<span class='sc'>Cambridge</span>” and “<span class='sc'>Oxford</span>”: together they hold upright what seems
intended for an optic glass or touchstone, but presents the exact appearance of a half-closed
umbrella. Facing the title and part of the plate is another engraving (plate
5½ × 3½ in., as the title) which a reference to pag. 77 l. 2 shows to represent the Temperaments
or complexions, with concentric rings: at top are two small wholly fanciful
engravings of “Oxford” and “Cambridge”, each 5/16 × 1<span class='fraction'>11<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> in.</p>

(2nd ed., Lond. 1621). The large engraved titlepage (9⅝ × 5⅛ in.) is similar to the
title of the 1626 London folio edition in general design, but different in detail. In
the 1632 engraving the title (nearly as on the printed leaf, as far as “G. S.”, with

The British Museum copy has the engraved title, but the copy presented by the

This book, as well as the same author’s <cite>Feminine Monarchie or history of Bees</cite> (see
1634 B), are printed in a peculiar phonetic manner. The system is of considerable
interest for the history of phonetic reforms of spelling and of English pronunciation,
but made no way in practical use. The preface asserts the superiority of English in
generality, by which he means wide geographical extent of usage, but laments the
uncertain correspondence of sound and spelling, and the labour of learning the language,
these two defects being due both to the want of alphabetical characters for certain
sounds, and to historical changes of pronunciation, to which some persons adapt the old
spelling and some do not. The author supplies the characters wanted, and counsels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>strictly phonetic spelling with certain exceptions where letters not strictly sounded
indicate idiom or derivation. Generally an aspirated letter is represented by a line
drawn through the letter (đ, w̶, ǥ, but ʇ), and mute vowels by a substituted comma (as
strang‘, tru‘, nam‘ly) when not omitted (as qestion). Also conjoined double e and
double o are used, but the exceptions to the phonetic spelling would be, among others,
a serious objection to this system of compromise. In 1585 W. Bullokar published an
edition of Æsop’s Fables in English, in a somewhat similar style of orthography.</p>

by the Oxford Turner in 1634, see 1634 S) to Michael Sparke on 17 Mar. 163<span class='fraction'>4<br /><span class='ov'>5</span></span>.
Neither of these books was registered at Stationers’ Hall, and so probably this book as
well as the <cite>Clavis</cite> was printed at Oxford, though the imprint, type and woodcuts are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>not by themselves decisive. Probably the two Turners are in fact identical, and the
Oxford printing establishment, though founded a year later than the other (but as
a bookseller’s business not later than 161<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>), was the chief one. It is curious that under
these circumstances Turner was allowed to be a member of the Stationers’ Company,
which was particularly jealous of provincial presses.</p>

<p class='c010'>A rare tract. See Wood’s <cite>Fasti Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, i. 479. The incident related
belongs to the year 1614, when the King of Persia put Ketaban to death for refusing
to forsake Christianity. Some Jesuits are said to have dressed up a carcase as Ketaban’s,
to have carried it to her son, and to have enjoyed much honour by the miracles
which it wrought. Ultimately the real body arrived and the Jesuits were banished.
The translator was Thomas Crosfield of Queen’s College, Oxford: and the Letter
was published in Greek and Latin (at London?) in 1632.</p>

<p class='c010'>The occasion of these verses seems to have been an illness of the King late in 1632.
Most of the poems are Latin, but four are English and one Greek. One of the printers
(W. Turner) contributes some Latin verses. An anagram occurs in the title, and
a chronogram (1632) on <span class='fss'>E</span>1<sup>v</sup>. There are curious variations in issues, and marks (see the
register of signatures) of the difficulty of obtaining and marshalling in order these collections
of separate poems. The early issues of sheet <span class='fss'>A</span> on <span class='fss'>A</span>3<sup>r</sup> print “<span class='sc'>R. Nevvlin</span>
<i>S. T. B.</i>”, the later and common ones insert <i>C. C. C.</i> after the name, as also in <span class='fss'>A</span>1<sup>v</sup>,
<span class='fss'>A</span>3<sup>r</sup> (twice): so “<i>Nov. C.</i>” is inserted on <span class='fss'>A</span>4<sup>v</sup>, cf. <span class='fss'>A</span>2<sup>v</sup>. An interesting copy is in the
British Museum, being the one specially printed for the King’s personal acceptance.
The differences are that the book is on larger paper (the size even as bound and cut
down being 7⅞ × 6 in.), and the title entirely reprinted. Every line of the title is in
larger type and spread out laterally, except the anagram itself and imprint: also ll. 1
and 4 are roman, not italic, and ll. 3, 4, 6, 7 are printed <i>in gold</i>. In l. 6 the two Vs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>are lower case Us, and in l. 7 Rex appears as <span class='sc'>Rex</span>. So too the device is altered, and
it is amusing to see that the imprint, for fear of royal vengeance, is altered from the
English “W. T.” (William Turner) to the Latin “G. T.”! This fact shows also that
the <i>last</i> and not the first copy was struck off for the King, sheet <span class='fss'>A</span> agreeing with this
in being the later issue (see above).</p>

Knott, and was published in 1630. By Oct. 1634 this first edition was nearly sold
out, and the author submitted a copy to archbp. Laud for his approval or correction,
with a view to a second edition. Laud suggested the alteration of a few passages,
and this was made part of the accusations against him at his trial (see Prynne’s
<cite>Canterburies Doom</cite>, Lond. 1646, p. 251). The second edition thus altered was printed
at London in 1634.</p>

independent of each other, there being no general titlepage, but yet being indissolubly
welded together by the signatures, so that no part could be issued separately. The
first edition seems to have been issued in 1587, the 4th at London in 1619. The plan
of the work is to assign a motto to every emperor, and then to discuss the motto and
character of the person together: so that in effect the book is largely a discussion of

<p class='c010'>See last item. The Argenis, which like the Satyricon is a political satire, was
written and first published in 1621. The first discursus must have been rather out of
date in this edition, for it suggests that the satire was written by William Barclay,
father of the author. Argenis is a female character in the book, apparently representing
the hope of the house of Valois.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the editor (<i>d.</i> 1608) see Wood’s <cite>Fasti Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, i. 249. The author,
a lawyer educated at Cambridge, died in 1597. The first edition, of which this is
a reprint slightly different in arrangement, was published at London in 1604, fol.: the
3rd at the Hague in 1661: the 4th at Oxford in 1684, fol. These tables exhibit the
whole status and administration of the Church of England in a synoptic form. The
words underlined in the above title are in red ink, as well as <i>Oxoniæ</i>, and <i>anno salutis
M.DC.XXIV.</i> in the imprint. The book is peculiar in form. The 1604 and 1684
editions may be called ordinary folios in shape: this one is made up of folio sheets
(each containing two folio leaves) folded once and bound oblong, the intention being
that the binder should cut through the line of folding at foot and bind the book as if
of quarto size, each oblong leaf thus bound being again awkwardly folded once so as
to lie within an ordinary quarto binding. In the present edition the original 16 tables

<p class='c010'>This is the early form of the Laudian Statutes. Its history may be read in Wood’s
History of the University or in Griffith’s and Shadwell’s edition of the later (1636) form,
published in 1888. Briefly, certain Delegates, especially dr. Zouch and Bryan Twyne
(who wrote the preface), completed their work, and the University sent up the Corpus
to the Chancellor, archbp. Laud. in Aug. 1633. He altered it and had it printed, and
in July 1634 declared that the Corpus thus printed (the present work) should be the
statutes under which the University should be governed for a year, Mich. 1634–Mich.
1635. Finally in June 1636 the full and authentic code was formally approved, and
additions from it were entered in the copies of the 1634 edition, the code not being
printed as a whole or precisely until 1888. In 1768 a new edition was printed with
certain changes and additions, and the 1768 edition is still in progress, the successive
statutes being still connected by paging with that issue.</p>

<p class='c010'>A large part of the edition is on parchment, being presented in that form to the King,
the chancellor of the University, each College, the Halls, and the Proctors. Blank
spaces are left in many places for additions. Large paper copies are also found. For
Synopsises of the statutes, see 1635 O, 1638 O.</p>

in the copies seen (one on large paper given by the author) has been sewn or pasted in
separately, an original titlepage having been torn out. Perhaps this was in order to
secure proper printing in red ink, for the words underlined in the title above are in red

Rouse, Bodley’s librarian, by Kinaston:
1–159 (“21” repeated after “24”), the
second book.</p>

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, iii. 38. The Latin translation is in a singular rhythmical
rhyming metre, essentially decasyllabic iambics, but with an extra unaccented syllable
at end, and with certain licences in revolving a long syllable into two short. The
rhymes are <i>ababbcc</i>. The first two lines for example are “Dolorem Troili duplicem
narrare | Qui Priami Regis Trojæ fuit gnatus.” This appears to be by far the earliest
translation of any part of Chaucer into another language. Part of a commentary on
the piece by sir F. Kinaston was printed in 1796. The English part is in black-letter,
the Latin in italic Roman. One of the complimentary poems is in would-be Chaucerian
style. The collation of this book is difficult: but probably it is this:—signn. <span class='fss'>A</span>, †,
*<sup>4</sup>, **<sup>2</sup>, (&nbsp;)<sup>1</sup>, <span class='fss'>B</span>-<span class='fss'>Z</span>, <span class='fss'>A</span>a-<span class='fss'>N</span>n<sup>4</sup>: †1-**<sup>2</sup> is matter foisted in, which prevented the true fourth
leaf of sign. <span class='fss'>A</span> from forming, as it should, the first leaf of the Latin translation (pp. 1–2
of the 1st book). Accordingly one of two plans was adopted: either the 4th leaf of
sign. <span class='fss'>A</span> was torn off, and a new 4th leaf inserted where the translation begins (which
seems to have been usually done, and which gives the collation above, assuming the
existence at one time of an <span class='fss'>A</span>4): or the torn-off fourth leaf was itself awkwardly
pasted on to sign. 2**.</p>

<p class='c010'>No imprint, but Oxford (?), 1635 (?): (one) la. 4<sup>o</sup>. Contents:—p. (1) the Encyclopædia.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a fine sheet, engraved by “T. Cecill” on metal, 16<span class='fraction'>3<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> × 16<span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> in. In the upper
part there is a dedication of “hæc Encyclopædia et Synopsis Statutorum” to archbp.
Laud. A large series of concentric circular spaces fill the centre, each divided into
a left hand and right hand half:—counting from the centre (a sun), (1) days of the
week, (2) hours of the day, (3) subjects, (4) explanation of the next circle, (5) List of
proper audience and books for each lecture: (6) explanation of the next circle, (7) lists
of fines for absent professors and absent audience: in the four corners are notes, one
of which supplies another title for the sheet, namely “Cyclus Prælectorum ... ex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Corpore Statutorum depromptus et delineatus ...”. Some copies (issued in 1638, see
below) have a small printed label “Iovis” pasted over “Martis”, or else the plate
itself altered to “Iovis”, in the note that Easter Term ends on the <i>Tuesday</i> before
Pentecost, and a longer slip pasted at the foot containing a note about the teaching of
Arabic and Medicine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chart is usually found folded and pasted in the 1638 edition of the abridged
Statutes: but a copy in the University Archives is pasted <i>between</i> the two columns of
the 1635 <cite>Synopsis Statutorum</cite>, which in combination with the dedication quoted above
suggests that it was first issued in 1635, a natural year for it, when the interest in the
new Code of Statutes was fresh. There is nothing to suggest that it was printed away
from Oxford. The device in the title is a well-made representation of the University
arms with the motto “Sapientiæ et felicitatis”.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thomas Crossfield of Queen’s certainly edited the 1638 <cite>Statuta selecta</cite>, and may
have issued the <cite>Synopsis</cite> (which is in his style), and possibly therefore the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite>.
At any rate he took the plate of the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite> and used it in 1638. It is in his
own copy of the <cite>Statuta selecta</cite> that the altered plate is found (see above); and the
note about Arabic and Medicine is there in his own handwriting preceded by a ☛, just
as in the printed slip.</p>

Edmund (Maria) Bolton. The present edition was printed in London but published at
Oxford, and the title is the engraved one of 1618, by Simon Pass, displaying in the
upper centre a Roman, in the lower centre the title, an eagle at top, and symbols and
letterpress about, and altered in the imprint only. The collation assumes that a sheet of
ten leaves could not be printed and that a blank leaf is needed before and after the
prefatory matter: the title is on an inserted leaf. This edition was issued after the translator’s
death, and seems not to be entered in the London Stationers Company’s Registers.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the first Latin grammar printed at Oxford since 1518, and is issued “Cum
Privilegio.” The grammar itself was already, in its Latin form, more than a hundred
years old, and many editions of it had been printed. Other Oxford editions were issued
at least in 1651, 1672–3, 1675, 1679, 1687, 1692, 1699, 1709, 1714, 1733. For William
Lily see Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, i. 32. The signatures connect the two parts of
the book.</p>

<p class='c010'>The importance of this issue is considerable. In consequence of disputes between
John Lichfield and Turner, archbp. Laud’s attention had been called to the state of
printing at Oxford, and the absence of any such printing privileges as were possessed
by Cambridge. A charter of privileges was accordingly obtained, dated 12 Nov. 1632,
confirmed and amplified by another dated 13 March 163<span class='fraction'>2<br /><span class='ov'>3</span></span>. These allowed the
University to print Bibles, Prayerbooks, Grammars, Almanacs, &amp;c., which had till then
been the monopolies of the London Stationers’ Company and the University Press at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Cambridge. No Bibles or Prayerbooks were issued at Oxford till 1675, but this
Grammar and three Almanacs (see 1637 B, C, and W.) raised the standard of revolt
against monopoly. On 20 March 163<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span> the Stationers’ Company agreed to pay the
University £200 a year, if it would agree not to issue the classes of books in question,
and no further difficulties arose till after the Restoration.</p>

1 French. The number of English, and their separation from the rest is a mark of
change. Most copies want the folded sheet (about 11 × 6 in.), which contains an
engraved picture of a crown on a board supported at the four corners by a prince, two
princesses and an infant in a cradle, all upon a large pedestal. Beneath are six Latin
verses, beginning “Quam stabilis Quadrata,” and then “Ita augustissimo Domino suo
vovet humillima ancilla Acad. Oxon.” Curiously the engraving cannot possibly be
correct, since the place of prince James is taken by a female figure! Perhaps for this
reason the plate was soon suppressed: it is certainly now very rarely found.</p>

copies of the volume is extraordinary: there are no pages or signatures, but if <span class='fss'>A</span>-<span class='fss'>O</span>

<p class='c010'>John Booker was a prolific Almanac maker: his <cite>Almanac and Prognostication</cite> was
issued from 1631 to 1649: his <cite>Celestial Observations</cite> from 1651 to 1662, and the
<cite>Telescopium</cite> from 1659 to 1676, but the dates may be capable of extension, and as
Booker died in 1667, the <cite>Telescopium</cite> must have been carried on by a successor under
his name. Only this one issue was printed at Oxford, since the Stationers’ Company
bought out the University’s right of printing this and certain other kinds of book in
March 163<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>, see 1636 L, and <i>Booker</i>, <i>Wyberd</i> below. The underlined words in the
title are printed in red, as well as much of the woodcut border (which bears the signs
of the zodiac, the royal arms, and an open book), the words “Oxford,” “to the famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Universitie. 1637.” in the imprint, and many words in the text. The same astrological
woodcut occurs as in the Wyberd, but in a more injured state, showing that Wyberd had
precedence in point of date. Booker’s Almanac for 1636 was printed at Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, iii. 265 for the author, and 1636 P. This is
a collection of twenty sermons by dr. Prideaux from 1614, several preached before the
king or court, and several preached at Oxford: those delivered at the consecration of
Exeter College Chapel and about Gowrie’s conspiracy being of considerable interest.
All, except the second (which is grouped with the first) and the eleventh, have separate
titlepages, and are often cited as separate editions, but the signatures run throughout
the volume. Sign. Y consists of one leaf only, the other three having been obviously
intended for a one-leaf title and two-leaf dedication of the sermon following (no. x in
the above divisions, really the eleventh sermon), but apparently they were accidentally
omitted. Some were already printed, those before printed at Oxford being nos. i (see
1615 P), ii (see 1614 P), and ix (see 1625 P): and nos. i-vii at least, were printed
separately at London in 1621. Collections of these sermons are often found without
the general title and in a confused order.</p>

(see Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, iv. 336), which were reissued in 1658. The edition
of 1638 is simply a reissue of the sheets of the 1637 edition, with different imprint and

of this book in 1638 without the commendatory verses: this would be no doubt
an early issue. The engraved title is a fine one by W. Marshall, in which the words
of the ordinary title, with impr. 173, are on a shell held by two mermaids; behind
is a storm-tossed ship with the two lovers on board and Cupid in the stern, with
the city of “Alexandria” in the background. This title was probably intended to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>printed on the second leaf of the first section: but as it is, the frontispiece is on an
inserted leaf, and the true second leaf is torn out. This book seems to be still the only
English translation of the romance, except that in Bohn’s library.</p>

printing, but presumably from Edinburgh type: at p. 347 begins Oxford printing, the
prefatory matter being also Oxford work. It would appear that some Edinburgh printers
began a reprint, that the Oxford printers interfered and suppressed it, that with their
consent the part printed in Scotland was not destroyed but <i>protelata</i>, prolonged, given
a further lease of life, at London, and finally brought to Oxford and completed. The
woodcuts and details of printing point to the division being before p. 347. The

German, Spanish, and other languages, but this 4th part seems never to have been
issued separately in French (in Italian 1634, &amp;c.): and this Oxford volume though not

because concealed under initials. Some copies have 1639 on the titlepage.</p>

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, iii. 91. This book (which Wood erroneously
states was issued in 1636, and which was republished in 1664, 1674, 1684, 1687, 1704,
1719, 1727, 1742, 1752, 1820, 1838, 1845, 1846), was the effect and cause of considerable
controversy, Chillingworth having recently reverted from Roman Catholicism to
Protestantism, and the form of the book being that of an answer to part 1 of M. Wilson’s
<cite>Mercy and truth or Charity maintayn’d</cite> (1634), itself an answer to Potter’s <cite>Want of
Charity</cite> (see 1633 P). The controversy is well described in the Dict. of National
Biography. There was a suspicion that Wilson obtained advance copies of the sheets
of this book as it went through the press, see Laud’s History of the Chancellorship
under the year, where are also given the archbishop’s views about the advisability of
Chillingworth answering the second part also of Wilson’s book. The present volume
is headed “Part i.” throughout. The issue of this volume with an imprint showing
that it was published in London is said to have some slight changes, but they are not
easily to be found, and in general the two issues appear to be identical. The description
of the Errata and their cause shows that it was the custom, at least at Oxford, for
authors to revise their proofs—which has been recently denied.</p>

at Bentley hall in Essex are all by Christ Church men, 19 in English, 11 in Latin.
William Cartwright, Robert Burton, John Fell, Martin Llewellin and Jasper Mayne
are among the writers. Lord Bayning took his degree from Christ Church in 1633, but
was only 24 years old at his death, when the title became extinct.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are verses to congratulate the Queen on her safe delivery and condole with
her for the loss of the infant princess, who seems to have lived only a few hours. The
reference is apparently to the birth of the princess Catherine (<i>b.</i> and <i>d.</i> 29 Jan. 163<span class='fraction'>8<br /><span class='ov'>9</span></span>),
but the ordinary pedigrees and histories seem not to notice this event. The poems are
in Latin and English, except three Greek and two French. The printer (Lichfield)
contributes a poem at the end. The signatures show the hasty method of printing.</p>

by his brother Robert Randolph of Christ Church, Oxford. There are twelve sets of
complimentary verses, in Latin and English, by the editor, Owen Feltham, and others.

<p class='c010'>See Wood’s <cite>Ath. Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, ii. 141. The original MS. (finished 27 Oct. 1586)
is now part of MS. (Queen’s coll. Oxford no. 218). The method of this commentary
or rather analysis is scholastic and formal. The editor says that he rescued the
original MS. from a “rurale musæum,” when it was “pulvere situque squalidum, &amp;
tantum non sepultum.” The author died in 1613. It is curious that in Moss’s <cite>Manual
of classical bibliography</cite> (Lond., 1825, vol. i, p. 157) this book is called “Westerman,
Commentaria in Ethica Aristotelis. Oxon. 4to. 1640,” with a reference to Wood’s <cite>Ath.
Oxon.</cite>, ed. Bliss, ii. 141. The explanation is that <i>Westerman</i> heads the column in
Wood’s work, because the account of William Westerman follows Brerewood on that
column: but the ascription deceived even so acute a bibliographer as the late professor
Chandler in his List of editions of the Nicomachean Ethics (Oxf. 1878).</p>

The present edition closely resembles the London ones of 1633 and 1638. Probably
the “N. H.” who edited the next article below, edited this also, Carpenter having
died in 1628. The work is evidently intended to be read with a view to the political
circumstances of the time, under the disguise of dealing with “a sacred tragedy” from
Old Testament history.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is an anonymous history of Britain from the earliest times. The editor,
M(atthew) H(unt), does not mention the fact, that an undated edition was printed at
London by Henry Bynneman (who published from 1566 to 1587), with the title “De
rebus gestis Britanniæ commentarioli tres. Ad Ornatissimum Virum M. Henricum
Broncarem Armigerum E.S.”, from which it has been conjectured that the author’s
initials were “E.S.” The first words of the text are “Britannia est Insula natura
triquetra.” The name of Clain is given in the British Museum catalogue as the author
of an Amberg edition of 1603, and in Thomas Thorpe’s Catalogue of books (1851)
p. 51 an edition printed at Hamburg in 1598 is mentioned under the same name, but
I can find no account of the author, who probably lived at Amberg. Some have
ascribed the book to John Clapham, who published an English <cite>History of England</cite>

published at Toulouse in 1612, under the title <i>Traité de l’essence et guérison de l’amour</i>,
and at Paris in 1623 as <i>De la maladie d’amour, ou melancholie erotique</i>. If Robert
Burton was acquainted with the first edition of this book, as he well may have been,
there can be little doubt that he has taken or imitated the general method and treatment
of the subject, in his <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>: but the French author is surpassed
on his own ground. The research is greater and the felicities of language more
numerous and striking in Burton, while the plan is also further and distinctively
elaborated. There is no mention of Burton’s book in the poems prefixed to this
translation. The words underlined in the above title are printed in red, as well as
“Oxford,” and “sold by Edward Forrest . 1640.” in the imprint.</p>

with Philosophia and Poesis doing him honour, and a celestial sphere and Pegasus
above. On the pedestal are the words “Poems by Tho : Randolph. The 2<sup>d</sup> Edition
much Enlarged.”, and below is impr. 196. Each of the three parts is separately
paged, but the two plays are linked by the signatures, while the title alone connects
the plays with the poems. The Cambridge 1640 edition of “The Jealous Lovers”,
a comedy by Randolph, is not infrequently found bound with this volume, but has no

Hispanica tragædia</cite>, but neither Wood nor his editors have been aware of this earlier
edition. Both were anonymous, and the direct evidence for the authorship (which
need not be doubted) is difficult to find. Bp. Barlow wrote the author’s name on the
title of his copy of <cite>Pharamus</cite>. The poems imply that the play had been written some
years before 1640: the author matriculated at St John’s College, Oxford, in June 1634.</p>

where will be found a reproduction (in type) of the two titles and colophons. Of the
Pliny Dibdin states that one George Smith passed it on to Van Damme, from whom
Askew bought it for fifteen guineas. With respect to the Lystrius, it appears that the
“Mr. Dent” who purchased it at the Askew sale was an agent or pseudonym of
Mr. Alchorne. The volume bears a manuscript note pretending to be from
“i. Korsellis” at Haarlem in 1471, stating that the book came to him from his

had entered a copy of his edition of the book at Stationers’ Hall on 28 Aug. 1584, sent
his son to Oxford to buy up the whole of Barnes’s reprint: which was done. But
Barnes promptly printed “two ympressions more,” of which the present volume is no
doubt one. Possibly the preceding art. is the other re-impression, and Wight effectually
suppressed the whole first edition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Oxford Press of the fifteenth century is a peculiarly interesting
one. At present fifteen works are known to belong to it, ranging in date
from “1468” (1478?) to 1486 (148<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>?). Not only is its origin quite
independent, so far as is known, of Caxton’s printing, not only are new
products of the press still from time to time discovered, but the battle
which has been waged about the date of its establishment has made the
“1468” book a veritable typographical battleground, and in Henry
Bradshaw’s opinion a touchstone of intellectual acumen.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place some details of the various books will be given: then
an account of the type and presswork: and lastly a description of each
book supplementary to, and corrective of, that contained on pp. <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>–4.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>THE TYPE AND PRESS-WORK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Seven kinds of type were used, the use of which can be seen on p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>.
Facsimiles of all of them are given in plates II-V.</p>

<p class='c001'>These obviously divide the books into three groups. In the first
group of three (“1468”–14<span class='fraction'>79<br /><span class='ov'>80</span></span>) only type no. 1 is used. In the second
group of four (1480–82, Theodoric Rood) only types 2–3 are found. In
the last group consisting of eight (1483–148<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>, T. Rood and Thomas
Hunte) only types 4–7 are used, except that the peculiar black initial
type (no. 3) is occasionally still used.</p>

<p class='c001'>The press was of course a wooden hand-screw one, which was at first
employed to print one page at a time (Jerome), but after the first book
two pages and perhaps later four were struck off together. The earliest
printing press of which we have an engraving is as late as 1<span class='fraction'>499<br /><span class='ov'>500</span></span> (see an
article in <cite>Bibliographica</cite>, 1894, no. 2), but there was great conservatism
in detail, and from the early engravings and such researches as those
which Blades, De Vinne, Talbot Reed, and others have made, we know
many of the details of working in the earliest days.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 1. “1468”—14<span class='fraction'>79<br /><span class='ov'>80</span></span>.</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Cologne black.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—English, nearly (10 lines = 1<span class='fraction'>15<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> in. In modern English 10
lines = 1⅞ in.).</p>

<p class='c001'>Used in the Jerome, Aretinus and Aegidius, with no other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “upper case” (to use a modern expression) consisted of at
least 16 divisions, G, J, K, L, T, U, W, X, Y, Z not being used, and P
seldom in the Jerome, H being there used for both H and P. This misuse
is not found in the other two books. On the other hand there are two
forms of C, E, N, and Q, both probably mixed in the same division. Q
is in the Jerome almost always <img src='images/q.png' alt='reversed Q' height='16' /> (a peculiarity found in some ornamental
MSS., from the convenience of extending the tail into the margin),
in the Aretinus and Aegidius always Q: the letter is however identical
in all three books, but being on a square body it is in the Jerome turned
one quarter round.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c001'>The “lower case” consisted of at least 121 divisions. Of the simple
unmodified letters k and z are wanting, and except in the Jerome j (but ij
is found in all, colligated). There are two forms of p, r, and three of s, the
two p’s and r’s being used indiscriminately, but the two s’s (final) and the
ſ (initial and medial) having their proper use. Of colligated or modified
letters there are at least eighty-three, and of other symbols eleven (for -et,
&amp;, con-, -us [two], id est, full stop, colon, ?). Of these 121 about 95 are
common to all three. The signs of progress are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Jerome, contrasted with the other two, Q is except in two places
<img src='images/q.png' alt='reversed Q' height='16' />, H is generally used as P, and I have not elsewhere noticed ̓b, or j used
by itself. On the other hand in the two others, and not in the Jerome,
are found an extra short t in which the perpendicular stroke hardly appears
at all above the horizontal line, and eleven new forms, including fe, ff,
and pp in colligation. The Q and P are rightly used, always.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>So too in the Jerome and Aretinus compared with the Aegidius we find
that q is printed too high up, being in fact an inverted b, or, more accurately,
an inverted broken h occasionally used for b. In the Jerome
this is almost always the case, in the Aretinus as often as not, in the
Aegidius hardly ever. It may be accidental that B and H and three
minor modified letters are not found in the short Aegidius, that w (in wlt
= vult) is only found in the Jerome, <span class='ligature'>·|·</span> (= id est) only in the Aretinus: but
the occurrence of ؟ (= ?) and of printing in red ink <i>only</i> in the Aegidius, is
not insignificant.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relative order of the three may therefore be assumed to be as
above indicated.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Origin of the type.</i></h4>

<p class='c019'>It may be taken as certain that as Caxton’s type is based on Bruges
models, so the first Oxford type is ultimately derived from Cologne. Ulric
Zel began printing there at least as early as 1466, and the general
resemblance to his letters is clear. The likeness is still nearer when we
follow Zel’s influence on Arnold ther Hoernen (Cologne, from 1470),
Richard Paffroet of Cologne (Deventer, from 1477), and especially
a little-known Cologne printer named Gerard ten Raem de Bercka, whose
only dated book is of 1478. John of Westphalia (Alost and Louvain,
from 1473) and Jacobus de Breda, a successor of Paffroet at Deventer, also
supply similarities. In the case of Gerard we actually find, besides
a close general similarity, the same misuse of H as P. Unfortunately no
works printed by him, except the dated <cite>Modus Confitendi</cite> and an undated
<cite>Aesopus</cite>, are at present known, so that it must not be assumed that 1478
is his earliest or only date.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is at present also unsafe to assume that Theodoricus Rood of
Cologne who printed at Oxford in 1481–85 was the first Oxford printer,
or ever used type no. 1.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 2 (1480?-1482).</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Narrow Dutch Black.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—English, nearly (10 lines = just less than 2 in.).</p>

<p class='c001'>Used in the Cicero (1480?: by itself), Latin Grammar (1481?: by
itself), Ales (1481: chiefly, but with no. 3), and Latteburius (1482: chiefly,
but with no. 3).</p>

<p class='c001'>The “upper case” consisted of 22 letters (J, K, U, W omitted).</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c001'>The “lower case” consisted of at least 131 divisions. Of the simple
letters j only occurs in colligation with i (as ij), and there are two forms
of r, s (s, ſ) and y. There are about 93 colligated or modified letters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately it is very difficult to institute a close comparison of the
use of letters, so as to establish a proper order of the books, in consequence
of the fragmentary state of the Milo and the Latin Grammar.
The Milo can be clearly separated from the rest: the type is <i>spaced</i>, so
that 10 lines = between 2<span class='fraction'>9<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> and 2¾ in., and (&nbsp;), ؟ (= ?), | (= comma) are
found in it alone. In fact, but for the closest resemblance of actual type,
the Milo would have to be regarded as printed elsewhere: and it cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>yet be said to be quite certainly printed at Oxford. The Ales and Latteburius
are hardly to be distinguished in the use of type, but I have
observed w only in the Latteburius and Grammar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The origin of the type is probably to be looked for near Cologne, from
whence came Theodoricus Rood, the avowed printer of the Ales, and
where a Theodoricus, who may probably be identified with Rood, printed
in 1485–6 in a type smaller than, but similar to, the present one. The
narrow stilted look of the letters and the semicircular sweep in front of
the A are noticeable features. Henry Bradshaw detected a similarity
between this type and that of Arnold ther Hoernen at Cologne.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 3 (1481–1485).</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Heading and initial Black, a large special type.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—2-line English, nearly (10 lines = 4 in. -, 10 lines of 2-line
English = 3¾ in. +).</p>

<p class='c001'>Used only in the Ales (1481) and Latteburius (1482) (for the beginnings
of chapters), in the Lyndewoode (1483?: head lines) and the Phalaris
(1485: one line).</p>

<p class='c001'>The type is too sparsely used to enable us to describe the extent of the
fount: but F, G, J, j, K, k, v, W, w, X, Y, Z, z are not found: I and g
have two forms each; s, ſ are found; V is only used for the number five;
and nine modified or conjoined letters occur. The peculiarity of the
letters is a slipped or detached upper corner in B, L, N, which is found in
1506 in Quentell’s printing at Cologne, and may be compared with
a smaller form used by Jean Veldener at Culenburg in 1484.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 4 (1483?-1485?).</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Small Dutch Black.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—Pica, nearly (10 lines = 1<span class='fraction'>11<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> + in., 10 lines in Pica = 1<span class='fraction'>11<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> – in.).</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the small type of the Anwykyll and Lyndewoode (both 1483?),
the ordinary type of the Hampole, Logic, and Augustine (all 1483?), and
the small type of the Lyndewoode (1483?), and is used in the Textus
Alexandri (1485?). It is in many details similar to type 2, but may be
readily distinguished by the o being broad and round in type 4, instead of
narrow and oval as in type 2. There are two forms of S in type 4, and
only one in type 2. The capitals are identical with those of type 6.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fount consisted of 25 capitals (J, V, W wanting, but two forms of
D, S), 27 small letters (z wanting, but r, s double) and at least 95 modified
or conjoined letters, in all not less than 147 types. Seven of the last
class appear to be peculiar to the Logic, which may therefore be the
latest of the group.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 5 (1483–148<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>).</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Small Caxtonian Black.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—Great Primer, nearly (10 lines = 2<span class='fraction'>5<br /><span class='ov'>16</span></span> in., 10 lines of Great
Primer = 2⅜ in.).</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>This is the larger type of the Anwykyll, the largest but one (ordinary
large) of the Lyndewoode, the largest of the Augustine (all 1483?), the
ordinary one of the Phalaris (1485), is used in the Textus Alexandri
(1485?), and is the small type of the Festial (1486). The capitals are
identical with those of type 7.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are 19 capitals (J, K, V, W, X, Y, Z wanting) and 28 small
letters (j, z wanting, but d, g, r, s double), and at least 44 modified or conjoined
letters, five of which seem to be peculiar to the Festial, as is also
the use of k. In all there were not less than 91 types.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 6 (1483?).</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Large Dutch Black, a Church type going with no. 4.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—Pica, nearly (as no. 4).</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the larger type of the Hampole, the larger type (two half lines
only) of the Logic, the larger type imbedded in the small type of the
Lyndewoode, the intermediate type (one line) in the Augustine, and
occurs in the Anwykyll (all 1483?). The capitals are identical with
those of type 4.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are 22 capitals (J, K, V, W, Z wanting, but S double), 24 small
letters (j, k, w, z wanting, but r, s double), and at least 16 modified or
conjoined letters, in all not less than 62 types. Eight of the modified
letters appear to be peculiar to the Hampole.</p>

<h4 class='c036'><i>Type</i> 7 (1485?–148<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>).</h4>

<p class='c019'>Character:—Large Caxtonian Black, a Church type going with no. 5.</p>

<p class='c001'>Body:—Great Primer, nearly (as no. 5).</p>

<p class='c001'>This is used in the Textus Alexandri (1485?) and is the large type of
the Festial (148<span class='fraction'>6<br /><span class='ov'>7</span></span>). The capitals are identical with those of type 5.</p>

<p class='c001'>To judge from the Festial, there are 18 capitals (J, K, R, V, W, X, Y,
Z not being used), 24 small letters (k, w, y, z not found, but r, s double),
and at least 9 modified letters, 51 in all.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WATERMARKS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>At present the study of watermarks has not reached a stage at which
they are able to contribute scientific proofs of high importance, nor will
any proof be ever deducible from them except the earliest possible
occurrence of an undated issue, although probabilities of concurrent printing
may be arrived at. Only some plain facts, therefore, will be stated
with respect to their occurrence in the early Oxford books.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we take the first group (the Jerome, Aretinus and Aegidius), we find
no less than 26, out of a total of 50. The Rufinus has seven (two shared
with the others, one shared with the Aretinus only, one shared with the
Latteburius, and three peculiar to itself). The Aretinus has 22, most of
which are found in the later groups, but eight are peculiar to itself. The
Aegidius has two only, common to the group.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>In the second group (Cicero, Ales, Latteburius, Latin Grammar) there
appear to be 28, of which four are common to all the groups, one is shared
only with group one, seven only with group three, and sixteen are
peculiar.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the third group 38 occur, four of which are common to all the
groups, nine are shared with the first alone, seven with the second alone,
and eighteen are peculiar.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SEPARATE BOOKS.</h3>

<h4 class='c036'>1. <b>Jerome</b> (“1468,” see p. <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>).</h4>

<p class='c019'>The treatise of Tyrannius Rufinus on the Apostles’ Creed, here
ascribed to St. Jerome, was undoubtedly the first product of the Oxford
press. It bears the date of 17 December, 1468, as the day on which the
printing was finished. The colophon is clearly printed and bears no
mark of haste, nor does it show the smallest trace of alteration in any of
the copies seen by the present writer. Saturday is a reasonable day on
which to conclude a work. A facsimile of the colophon is given in
plate II.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately for the peace of the bibliographer two spectres have
haunted this book, one of which “pulveris exigui jactu” has been laid,
but the other is not yet gone, although there is a prospect of ultimate
eviction.</p>

<h5 class='c036'>I. <span class='sc'>The Corsellis forgery.</span></h5>

<p class='c019'>In 1664 Richard Atkyns, a Gloucestershire gentleman of some position,
and educated at Balliol, issued a book, the title of which sets forth
with unusual clearness the object of the volume:—“The Original and
Growth of Printing: Collected Out of History, and the <i>Records</i> of this
Kingdome. Wherein is also Demonstrated, That Printing appertaineth to
the <i>Prerogative Royal</i>; and is a Flower of the <i>Crown</i> of <i>England</i>. By
Richard Atkyns, <i>Esq</i>:” (London, printed by John Streater, for the Author,
<span class='fss'>MDCLXIV</span>: quarto: pp. [12] + 24). Atkyns’s object was to recommend
himself to Charles II’s attention by proving that printing was a royal
privilege: and for this it was very desirable that there should be evidence
of the introduction of the art into England under royal protection. The
testimony of Stowe—corroborated by Howell—that “William Caxton of
London, Mercer,” introduced it in 1471, was unsuitable. Atkyns, however,
came upon a copy of the “1468” Oxford book, and “the same
most worthy Person who trusted me with the aforesaid Book, did also
present me with the Copy of a Record and Manuscript in <i>Lambeth</i>-House,
heretofore in his Custody, belonging to the See (and not to any
particular Arch-Bishop of <i>Canterbury</i>); the substance whereof was this
(though I hope, for publique satisfaction, the Record it self, in its due time,
will appear).” Then ensues the following story:—</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Thomas Bourchier</i>, Arch-Biſhop of <i>Canterbury</i>, moved the then King
(<i>Hen.</i> the 6th) to uſe all poſſible means for procuring a
Printing-Mold (for ſo ’twas there called) to be brought into this
Kingdom; the King (a good Man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>much given to Works of this Nature)
readily hearkned to the Motion; and taking private Advice, how to
effect His Deſign, concluded it could not be brought about without
great Secrecy, and a conſiderable Sum of Money given to ſuch Perſon or
Perſons, as would draw off ſome of the Workmen from <i>Harlein</i> in
<i>Holland</i>, where <i>John Cuthenberg</i> had newly invented it, and was
himſelf perſonally at Work: ’Twas reſolv’d, that leſs then one
Thouſand Marks would not produce the deſir’d Effect: Towards which
Sum, the ſaid Arch-Biſhop preſented the King with Three Hundred Marks.
The Money being now prepared, the Management of the Deſign was
committed to Mr. <i>Robert Turnour</i>, who then was of the Roabs to the
King, and a Perſon moſt in Favour with Him, of any of his Condition:
Mr. <i>Turnour</i> took to his Aſſiſtance Mr. <i>Caxton</i>, a Citizen of good
Abilities, who Trading much into <i>Holland</i>, might be a Creditable
Pretence, as well for his going, as ſtay in the <i>Low Countries</i>: Mr.
<i>Turnour</i> was in Diſguiſe (his Beard and Hair ſhaven quite off) but
Mr. <i>Caxton</i> appeared known and publique. They having received the
ſaid Sum of One Thouſand Marks, went firſt to <i>Amſterdam</i>, then to
<i>Leyden</i>, not daring to enter <i>Harlein</i> it ſelf; for the Town was very
jealous, having impriſoned and apprehended divers Perſons, who came
from other Parts for the ſame purpoſe: They ſtaid till they had ſpent
the whole One Thouſand Marks in Gifts and Expences: So as the King was
fain to ſend Five Hundred Marks more, Mr. <i>Turnour</i> having written to
the King, that he had almoſt done his Work; a Bargain (as he ſaid)
being ſtruck betwixt him and two <i>Hollanders</i>, for bringing off one of
the Work men, who ſhould ſufficiently diſcover and teach this New Art:
At laſt, with much ado, they got off one of the Under-Workmen, whoſe
Name was <i>Frederick Corſells</i> (or rather <i>Corſellis</i>), who late one
Night ſtole from his Fellows in Diſguiſe, into a Veſſel prepared
before for that purpoſe; and ſo the Wind (favouring the Deſign)
brought him ſafe to <i>London</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>’Twas not thought ſo prudent, to ſet him on Work at <i>London</i>, (but by
the Arch-Biſhops meanes, who had been Vice-Chancellor, and afterwards
Chancellor of the Univerſity of <i>Oxon</i>) <i>Corſellis</i> was carryed with a
Guard to <i>Oxon</i>; which Guard conſtantly watch’d, to prevent
<i>Corſellis</i> from any poſſible Escape, till he had made good his
Promiſe, in teaching how to Print: So that at <i>Oxford</i> Printing was
firſt ſet up in <i>England</i>, which was before there was any
Printing-Press, or Printer, in <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Italy</i>, or
<i>Germany</i>, (except the City of <i>Mentz</i>) which claimes Seniority, as to
Printing, even of <i>Harlein</i> it ſelf, calling her City, <i>Urbem
Maguntinam Artis Tipographicæ Inventricem primam</i>, though ’tis known
to be otherwiſe, that City gaining that Art by the Brother of one of
the Workmen of <i>Harlein</i>, who had learnt it at Home of his Brother,
and after ſet up for himſelf at <i>Mentz</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Preſs at <i>Oxon</i> was at leaſt ten years before there was any
Printing in <i>Europe</i> (except at <i>Harlein</i>, and <i>Mentz</i>) where alſo it
was but new born. This Preſs at <i>Oxford</i>, was afterwards found
inconvenient, to be the ſole Printing-place of <i>England</i>, as being too
far from <i>London</i>, and the Sea: Whereupon the King ſet up a Preſs at
St. <i>Albans</i>, and another in the Abby of <i>Weſtminster</i>, where they
Printed ſeveral Bookes of Divinity and Phyſick, (for the King, for
Reaſons beſt known to himſelf and Council) permitted then no Law-Books
to be Printed; nor did any Printer exerciſe that ART, but onely ſuch
as were the Kings ſworn Servants; the King himſelf having the Price
and Emolument for Printing Books.</p>

<p class='c010'>Printing thus brought into <i>England</i>, was moſt Graciouſly received by
the King, and moſt cordially entertained by the Church, the Printers
having the Honour to be ſworn the King’s Servants, and the Favour to
Lodge in the very Boſome of the Church; as in <i>Weſtminſter</i>, St.
<i>Albans</i>, <i>Oxon</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>As no one believes in this story it is not worth while to do more than
to point out that no corroboration of it has ever been found, (much less
the original record discovered), that Henry VI was deposed 4 March 146<span class='fraction'>0<br /><span class='ov'>1</span></span>,
and that the type shows no resemblance to that of Haarlem. Nor does
the rest of the book concern us. The tale, however, in the absence of
contradiction, obtained some vogue, so that we find for instance in Layer
Marney church in Essex some such inscription as the following “Præ-missus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>non amissus, Nicolas Corsellis Armiger Dominus hujus manerii

There is no question that this clumsy forgery of Atkyns has had its effect
in befogging the subject to which it relates, and has predisposed critics to
suspect the date of the first Oxford book.</p>

<h5 class='c036'>II. <span class='sc'>The disputed date, “1468.”</span></h5>

<p class='c019'>The first who threw doubt on the recorded date of the Jerome was
Conyers Middleton in his <cite>Dissertation on the origin of Printing</cite> published
in 1735, and since then the opinion that 1468 is an error for 1478 (an
<span class='fss'>X</span> having dropped out of “<span class='fss'>MCCCCLXXVIII</span>”) has steadily gained ground
with the advance of critical methods, until authorities like Bradshaw
and Blades and Duff have come to regard the question as settled. The
only two separate and formal defences of the date (not counting incidental
passages in books) are a MS. in the Guildhall Library in London, in
a volume of Stukeley’s <cite>Palæographia Britannica</cite> marked B. 2. 1, perhaps
written in about 1770, and S. W. Singer’s <cite>Some Account of the book printed at
Oxford in <span class='fss'>MCCCCLXVIII</span></cite> (London, 1812, 50 copies for private distribution),
a work which the author subsequently called in as far as he was able. In
the former the arguments are of a general character, such as that if, as
Middleton asserted, the King had not leisure to attend to such matters
during Civil War, the archbishop <i>had</i>, and that Caxton’s silence counts
for nothing in the general obscurity which surrounds the earliest printing
presses. The Corsellis story is accepted. Singer is more scientific, as
befits the later date, and adduces several of the technical arguments which
may still be used.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is now time to state the present aspect of the dispute, and to ascertain
how far the date “1468” is not only dubious but untenable. The
arguments against the date may be stated in presumed order of their
cogency, with the remarks on the other side which they severally suggest.</p>

<h6 class='c036'>1. <i>The presence of Signatures.</i></h6>

<p class='c019'>The Jerome presents to our eyes the ordinary signatures to which we
are accustomed in fifteenth-century books, that is to say the marks a j, a ij,
a iij, a iiij on the recto of each of the four leaves which form the first half
of the sections of eight leaves (sixteen pages) of which the book is generally
composed. These are placed just below the last letters of the printed
page, close under them. Now the earliest known book with a date in
which signatures elsewhere occur in this developed form is an <cite>Expositio
Decalogi</cite>, by Johannes Nider, printed at Cologne by Koelhoff in 1472, the
next being a Cologne book by F. de Platea in 1474. The argument is
that it is extremely unlikely that an isolated printer in a provincial town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>in England should make such a discovery and advance, and that the next
similar book should be a German one four years later<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>What may be called the common ground of the discussion on this
point is well explained in Blades’s <cite>Books in Chains</cite> (Lond. 1892), pp.
85–122, in a paper on Signatures. He shows that the idea of signatures
in manuscripts is as old as books themselves, but that in manuscripts
the marks, being in writing and intended for the binder’s eye alone,
were naturally, as a rule, at the foot or corner of the page, and often
cut off in the process of binding. When printing came in, the obvious
difficulty was to print marks so far from the rest of the printed page as to
be cut off in binding. This difficulty was met in two ways: either the
signatures were <i>written in</i> at the extreme foot (from 1462?), or the signatures
were stamped on by hand with single types (from 1473?). Some
printers, however, did manage by care to print signatures far from the
text (1474 on?). Ultimately in a single case in 1472 and with increasing
frequency from 1474 printers found that the essential ugliness of printed
signatures close to the page was counterbalanced by the utility and convenience
of the change, and our modern system was begun.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, it must be constantly remembered that the entire weight of disproof
lies with those who dispute the printed date. This is why it is
simply amusing to read Blades’s sage words on the subject of this 1472
book with normal printed signatures. He is pledged to renounce the
Oxford date, but he finds it awkward that there <i>is</i> an isolated book of
1472 in precisely the same category—with the same want of precedent,
the same absence of imitators, the same forlorn appearance. Observe how
he deals with it (p. <a href='#Page_116'>116</a> of the book above cited):—“This is a puzzling
book, for it is at least two years earlier than any other book so signed.
In this city, too. [i. e. Lübeck<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a>] many works were issued with MS. signatures
with a later date than this. It is dangerous to assert that a book is
wrongly dated because you cannot make it fit into a bibliographical
theory; but I feel inclined, from the general aspect of the book, to date
it as 1482, rather than 1472.” And yet a very high authority on typography
assures me that the book is <i>undoubtedly</i> of 1472! What then
prevents the tentative and isolated experiment of Cologne from having
a similar tentative and isolated forerunner, even at Oxford? We
may remember too that in the infancy of printing it was common
to detect errors as the book went through the press, and often the printer
himself corrected an error with his pen, as in the colophon of the Aegidius
(see p. <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>). Or a reader would do the same. But it is believed that in no
copy of the Jerome is there any attempt to correct or even throw
suspicion on the date. There is the date, plain and detailed, and it is
allowable to wait for scientific proof before it is abandoned. <i>A priori</i>
considerations have force, but they are liable to sudden overthrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Clearly the consideration of signatures alone cannot avail to disprove
the date of the Jerome. But much more remains.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h6 class='c036'>2. <i>Signs of progress.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c019'>It is said that, if we consider the interval between 1468 and 1479, we
shall reasonably expect definite signs of progress. On the contrary, the
first three Oxford books are printed with the same type, with similar
signatures, with the same sized page and the same number of lines in
a column. “In fact,” says Blades in the <cite>Antiquary</cite>, vol. iii, no. 13, Jan.
1881, in an article on <cite>The First Printing Press at Oxford</cite>, “if a leaf of one
was extracted and inserted in another it would, typographically, excite no
remark.” <i>Natura nihil facit per saltum</i>, and we are accustomed to apply
the idea of evolution and development to every art and trade. It is
asserted also that there is no other case of the cessation of a press for
over ten years. But cessation of printing for such a time is not unknown.
No book was produced at Bamberg between 1462 and 1480, or at Caen
between 1480 and 1500, or at Brussels between 1484 and 1500, or at
Haarlem for some years after 1486, or at Saragossa after 1475 till 1485?
Moreover the only early printing known at Tavistock is two books in
1525 and 1534. The <i>same type</i> and <i>identical woodcuts</i> are found in the
two, with an interval of nine years. And where there is cessation, it is
obvious that we may be content with fewer signs of advance when work
is resumed at the same press with the same type, than if the activity had
been continuous, or if the instruments were changed.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this question of progress is a plain issue. Are there no signs of
advance in the two later books compared with the earlier one?</p>

<p class='c001'>The first book often has an unevenness at the right-hand edge of
a column (in 28 pages out of 84). In the other two it is always perfectly
even<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a>. Again, the Jerome starts printing on sign. a 1, whereas the other
two start with a blank leaf, the printing beginning on a 2. Again, in the
Jerome there is a peculiar misuse of the capitals H and Q (see p. <a href='#Page_241'>241</a>),
not found in the following books. And lastly, to omit smaller matters,
there is the decided and important fact that whereas in the Jerome each
page was printed separately, in the Aegidius and Aretinus two pages were
printed at a time.</p>

<h6 class='c036'>3. <i>The Type.</i></h6>

<p class='c019'>Of the palmary arguments against the date, one still remains. The
first Oxford type presents a remarkable similarity to that used by
Gerard ten Raem de Bercka (see p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), and his only dated book at
present known is of 1478. There is certainly a real connexion between
the two founts, but we know so extremely little of this printer that it is at
present unsafe to base any conclusion on his work. The typographical
genealogy of the early printers of the Netherlands and Germany has not
yet been fully drawn out, and of the 1478 <cite>Modus Confitendi</cite> (Hain 11455),
which is here in question, only two copies <i>with the date</i> are known,
one in the John Rylands (Spencer) library at Manchester and one on the
continent. On this point we shall doubtless know more in time, but at
present we are bound to suspend our judgment.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>
  <h6 class='c036'>4. <i>Mistakes of date common.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c019'>There are two subsidiary considerations left. One is that mistakes of
date in colophons are not uncommon. An edition of Aeneas Sylvius’s
<cite>Epistolae</cite> (Cologne, printed by Koelhoff) is dated <span class='fss'>MCCCCLXVIII</span>, which is
stated to be an error for 1478, and an <cite>Opusculum de componendis versibus</cite> by
Mataratius, printed at Venice, is also believed to be erroneously dated 1468
for 1478. Caxton’s edition of Gower’s <cite>Confessio Amantis</cite> is dated 1493
instead of 1483. I have noticed the following additional errors affecting
dates before 1501:—720 for 1720, 1061 for 1601, 1099 for 1499, 1334
for 1734, 1400 for 1490 or 1500, 1444 for 1494, 1461 for 1471, 1461
for 1641, 1462 for 1472, 1472 for 1482.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt therefore that a mistake of date in an early book
has many parallels, and so far the improbability of it happening in other
books is diminished. At the same time one would expect the first printers
in a place of learning to be careful enough, even if an initial blunder of
this magnitude were committed, to correct it in some copies before issue.
It is of course conceivable that the date was deliberately falsified, to avoid
expected unpleasant consequences of being found <i>flagrante delicto</i>, but
this hypothesis may be left to be dealt with when some one maintains it.</p>

<h6 class='c036'>5. <i>Books bound with the Jerome.</i></h6>

<p class='c019'>There remains a consideration of some weight. Until this century it
was common to bind together several books (not merely pamphlets) in one
volume. What books have been found in the same binding with the
“1468” volume? Four copies of the Jerome are, or are known to have
been, bound with several other treatises (see p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>). One is bound with
(and before) the Aretinus of 1479, and it is interesting that though a few
leaves of modern paper now separate them there is an offset of the first
page of the Aretinus on the last page of the Jerome, showing that the
Aretinus was bound with the Jerome before the former was entirely dry.
No conclusion however about the date of the Jerome can be drawn from
this and whatever presumption of synchronism might be raised is removed
by the fact that the well defined stains at the end of the Jerome and
beginning of the Aretinus do <i>not</i> run from the one to the other. A second
copy was bound with seven others, only two of which are dated, 1478 and
(the Oxford Aegidius) 1479: one of the undated is about 1485 (Perottus).
A third copy was bound with four preceding treatises, of which the only
dated one was the first, the Oxford Aegidius of 1479. A fourth has five
pieces with it, the first two of which are of about 1480, the Jerome is
third, the fourth is of 1485, the fifth is undated, and the last is of 1486
or 1487.</p>

<p class='c001'>Clearly we are on very unsafe ground when we base any conclusion on
these companion treatises, and our hesitation is not lessened when we
notice that the only copy of the <cite>Vulgaria Terentii</cite> (Oxf., not later than
1483) which is bound with other treatises, occurs after books dated 1488
and 1486, the rest being without a date.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h6 class='c036'>6. <i>First printing in Europe.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The following list of places and dates will show how far it is likely, if
we turn from facts to probabilities, that Oxford should have started
printing in 1468. Only the first two towns of each country are given,
with the exception of England: and the claim of Oxford is purposely
ignored.</p>

<p class='c037'>1. Germany (Mainz, not after 1454: Strassburg, before 1460:
Cologne began not later than 1466).</p>

<p class='c037'>2. Italy (Subiaco, 1465: Rome, 1467).</p>

<p class='c037'>3. Switzerland (Basel, not after 1468: Beromünster, 1470).</p>

<p class='c037'>4. France (Paris, 1470: Lyon, not after 1473).</p>

<p class='c037'>5. Netherlands (Utrecht, about 1471–3: Alost, 1473).</p>

<p class='c037'>6. Austro-Hungary (Buda-Pesth, 1473: Trient, 1475).</p>

<p class='c037'>7. Spain (Valencia, 1474: Saragossa, 1475).</p>

<p class='c037'>8. England (Westminster, 1477: Oxford, 1478: St. Alban’s, 1480
[1479?]: London, 1480).</p>

<p class='c037'>9. Denmark (Odensee, 1482: Schleswig, 1486).</p>

<p class='c037'>10. Sweden (Stockholm, 1483: Wadsten, 1495).</p>

<p class='c037'>11. Portugal (Lisbon, 1489: Leiria, 1492).</p>

<p class='c037'>12. Montenegro (Cettinje, 1494).</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c001'>It is hoped that the above summary statement of the arguments for and
against the date of the Jerome will serve to make the present position of
the question clear. What general conclusion can be arrived at before
further facts are discovered? Caxton, who began to print in England in
1477, nowhere claims to have introduced printing into England. Is it
still conceivable that Oxford preceded Westminster by nine years? The
answer is that it is still conceivable, but not probable. The ground has
been slowly and surely giving way beneath the defenders of the Oxford
date, in proportion to the advance of our knowledge of early printing,
and all that can be said is that it has not yet entirely slipped away. All
the new contributions to the argument and all the chief bibliographers
are against it, while no fresh defending forces are in sight. But it is
still allowable to assert that the destructive arguments, even if we admit
their cumulative cogency, do not at the present time amount to proof.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the venerable building at the north-east corner of St. Mary’s Church
at Oxford—the old House of Congregation, which, though once the cradle
of the University,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>

      <div class='line'>Nunc situs informis premit et deserta vetustas—</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>there is still a single tenant, feebly holding his ground and refusing to be
evicted. He wears the form of King Alfred and bears a legend beneath,
telling us boldly that he founded the University<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a>. The clamour of disputation
never reaches that silent room, the changes of centuries have
disregarded it, and it remains the one place where a belief which cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>a lustre of royalty over early Oxford, and to this day gives primacy to one
of the oldest colleges, is still maintained without contradiction. The
figure neither utters nor listens to argument: it asserts and chooses to
assert. But the spirit of the age is at the door: St. Mary’s is swathed in
scaffolding: the sounds of trowel and saw penetrate through the dim glass
and the cobwebs and all things become new. It is probable that the
opening years of the twentieth century will see the age-worn bust of Alfred
and the copy of the Oxford Jerome in the University archives consigned
to a common flame as Impostors in an age of light.</p>

usage of the time and which gains a slight probability, in that the printing
would have been finished on a Sunday, if the year were taken as 147<span class='fraction'>8<br /><span class='ov'>9</span></span>.
All copies are poorly printed. It was quite fitting that the first book
printed at Oxford should be theological and the second the Nicomachean
Ethics of Aristotle.</p>

<p class='c037'>3. John Rylands Library, Manchester. Wanting a 1 and c 8, blank leaves and a 8.
Purchased by Lord Spencer: once part of the volume containing the Jerome

<h4 class='c036'>4. <b>Cicero, Pro Milone</b> (1480?, see p. <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>).</h4>

<p class='c019'>This is a puzzling book. The type so closely resembles Oxford type
that every bibliographer has accepted it provisionally as identical. Yet
it exhibits spaced type, it uses / for a comma (both points unique in
Oxford printing), and the sections are made up in sixes. It is also by
many years the first classic printed in England, the next being a Terence
in 1497. The volume probably consisted of a—e in sixes, allowing
a leaf blank at the beginning: perhaps section e was in eight. The first
half of each section bears signatures. The book was clearly made up of
half quarto sheets, three to each section. Mr. Blades was of opinion that
the type was more worn than that of the Ales: and Mr. E. G. Duff thinks
that the spacing and other peculiarities point to a later date than 1480.</p>

<p class='c037'>Fragments known:—b 3–4, c 3–4 are in the Bodleian (Auct. R. supra 3), having been
presented by Sir William H. Cope in 1872. They were fly leaves in a volume
containing five treatises dated from 1491 to 1505, probably bound in Oxford
for William Cope (d. 1513) who lived near Banbury. Also c 1–2, 5–6 are in
Merton College Library, Oxford, among some loose printed fragments.</p>

<h4 class='c036'>5. <b>Latin Grammar</b> (1481?, see p. <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>).</h4>

<p class='c019'>This is only known from two leaves in the British Museum, acquired
in 1872 or late in 1871, which were found in the binding of a book,
which in the sixteenth cent. belonged to Nicholas Browere. It is
a Latin grammar in English, the examples of which connect its composition
with Oxford (e. g. “I goo to grammer att Oxforde Incumbo
grammatice Oxonij,” “Y go to Oxforde Eo Oxonium vel ad Oxonium.”)
From letters in the <cite>Athenaeum</cite>, 4 and 11 Nov. 1871, and notes in the
book, it appears that the author might be John Anwykyll (see p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>)
and that it is probably not by Holt or Stanbridge. The chain lines run
across the page: but it is at present impossible to say whether the sections
were in sixes or eights. Marked C. 33. i. 10.</p>

<h4 class='c036'>6. <b>Ales</b> (1481, see p. <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>).</h4>

<p class='c019'>The woodcut border which is found in some copies of the Ales and
Latteburius is the earliest found in English printing, though Caxton uses
woodcut engravings in the text (for the first time) in the same year. It
consists of birds and flowers grouped on long winding stems, the four
pieces which form the border measuring in all not less than 11¼ × 7¾ in.
(no quite intact copy is known, the binder’s ruthless knife invariably
removing a portion). A full-size reproduction of it is given in E. G.
Duff’s <cite>Facsimiles of English types</cite> (Lond. 1895).</p>

<p class='c038'>3. Oxford—All Souls. Without border. On vellum. Perfect, except that part of

The binding is contemporary Oxford stamped leather. This copy is remarkable
from the fact that four names, apparently of parchment-sellers, occur as
signing certain leaves: on 54 leaves (representing 108) F. H.: on 31, Hawkyns
or Haukins: on 8, Alison: on 3, J. Alexander (Alysaunder): probably some
other signings are cut off. A comparison of two sets of similar markings in
other books almost establishes the fact that these names do not represent
revisers of the printing, but dimply the owners of the parchment. Sometimes
“8 ff,” and once “8 ff alison,” occur, showing that the pieces were sold in
bundles of eight (?). Marked P. <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>. 18, then QQ. 8. 11.</p>

  <h4 class='c036'>8. <b>Anwykyll</b> (1483?, see p. <a href='#Page_3'>3</a>).</h4>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Four of the chief English grammarians of the 16th century were connected
with Magdalen College Grammar School at Oxford. The first
master was John Anwykyll (1481?-87); the first usher and second
master was John Stanbridge (1481?-88, 1488–94, <i>d.</i> 1510); John Holte,
the author of the <cite>Lac Puerorum</cite>, was master; and Robert Whittington
was Stanbridge’s pupil at the school. Dean Colet, William Lily and
Cardinal Wolsey were also members of Magdalen (see Bloxam’s <cite>Register
of Magdalen College</cite>, iii., ad init.). Of the Latin Grammar in Latin which
is now before us and has been assigned with probability by Bradshaw to
Anwykyll, no complete copy is known, but it was reprinted at Deventer
in 1489. The <cite>Vulgaria Terentii</cite> occurs also separately, and consists of
sentences from Terence with English translation.</p>

<p class='c001'>There appear to be two different editions of this Grammar (not
Vulgaria), for it can be shown that the Cambridge fragments are not of
the same edition as the Bodleian book. Not only, for instance, are the
contents of sign. h 3 in each entirely different, but the signatures themselves
are in different type, and in the Corpus (Cambridge) fragment
the signature is n 3, and yet it belongs to the Compendium and not the
Vulgaria. The height of the printed page also varies considerably, and
the width of the Vulgaria pages is less than that of the Grammar. The
subject needs further investigation.</p>

<p class='c019'>The computation of the date by Olympiads is very uncommon, in
early printed books: it is however the most ancient classical method.
Each Olympiad is a period of four years, and the first is computed to
have commenced in July, <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> 776: so that July <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1 corresponded
with the beginning of Olympiad 195. The computation ceased for
practical purposes in <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 395, and the present revival is of an artificial
kind, in which the expression “every fifth year,” which by a Greek could
be applied to an Olympiad (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Πενταετηρίς</span>), was taken in its ordinary sense
and used for computation. Thus “in the 297th Olympiad from the birth
of Christ” was in the present book taken to represent (297 × 5 =)
<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1485. A similar use is found in the 1472 (Venice) edition of the
Epigrams of Ausonius<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. But the 1494 (Parma) edition of the Declamations
of Quintilian contains a futile attempt to use the ancient method,
for it was printed “Olympiade quingentesima sexagesima octaua qui est
annus a salute christiana M.cccc.xciiii quinto non. Iul.”, whereas it would
properly have been 1493. And M. A. Giry (<cite>Manuel de Diplomatique</cite>,
1894, p. 96) records an unintelligible attempt to use this computation in
a deed of 1102.</p>

Bradshaw suggests that the eleven large cuts were perhaps intended for

belong to a lost Oxford Primer on Horae. The text is nearer to that
of Caxton’s second issue (1491) than of his first (1483). The two sets

indicated simply by horizontal lines (as in a French <cite>Ortus Sanitatis</cite> of

<p class='c006'>From December 1517 to February “1519” (15<span class='fraction'>19<br /><span class='ov'>20</span></span>?) a printing press is
found in work at Oxford in St. John’s Street near Merton College, connected
in 1518 with the name of Johannes Scolar and in the last book
with the name of Carolus Kyrfoth. Both of these appear to be foreigners,
but nothing certain has yet been discovered about them or the causes of the
establishment and cessation of the press<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a>. In 1524 none of these names
occurs among the inhabitants of Oxford paying taxes (Oxf. Hist. Soc.,
<cite>City Documents</cite>, ed. by J. E. T. Rogers, 1891, p. 5): nor are they otherwise
known in Oxford as booksellers or stationers. Although Scolar
uses the arms of the University (their earliest occurrence in print), yet
the Registers of the University almost entirely ignore the fact that for
the second time the greatest literary invention since speech and writing
were known, was silently at work in its midst. Three of the books were
however issued “Cum Privilegio.” It is peculiar that whereas theology
claimed a fair proportion of the first press, it is entirely absent from the
second; grammar, logic, arithmetic, natural science, and the Ethics of
Aristotle being alone represented, except that one broadside consists of a
Prognostication, which Dorne’s lists in 1520 show to have been a popular
form of literature in Oxford at that time. All are in small quarto, and
similar in the types used, namely an English and Brevier black-letter,
with a Great Primer for titles. Not only at Oxford but also at Cambridge,
York, Tavistock, and Abingdon, in all of which there was an
early 16th cent. press, printing entirely ceases for nearly the central forty
years of that century.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX C.<br /> <span class='large'>A CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF PERSONS AND PROCEEDINGS CONNECTED WITH BOOK-PRODUCTION AT OXFORD, A.D. 1180–1640.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Three districts in Oxford are associated with the early production of
books.</p>

<p class='c001'>One is Bookbinders Bridge, which is still standing, namely the bridge
which as one starts from close under the Castle in Titmouse Lane
towards St. Thomas’s Church, crosses the second piece of water. The
bridge was on the limits of Oseney Abbey and the neighbouring tenements
were largely occupied by binders who worked for the Abbey. See Clark’s
edition of Wood’s <cite>History of the City</cite>, i. 433.</p>

<p class='c001'>Schidyard St., now Oriel St., is said to imply by its name that it was
the locus schediasticorum, the place of writers on <i>schedae</i> or sheets of
paper. Certainly with St. John Baptist St. (now Merton St.) and Cat St.,
it was a great centre for scribes, illuminators, bookbinders, and the like.
See Clark’s Wood, as above, i. 139, 175, 184.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also Cheney Lane, earlier St. Mildred’s Lane, and now Market St., was
largely tenanted by the same class. See Clark’s Wood, i. 72.</p>

<p class='c001'>The stationarius (or virgifer) of the University was regularly appointed
(see Clark’s <cite>Register of the University</cite>, vol. ii, pt. 1, p. 261), and was
generally employed to value the books of a scholar after death or sequestration.</p>

<p class='c001'>But these general facts require to be supplemented by the details which
follow: with respect to which it must be remembered that many persons
combined several of the trades here recorded, and that, for instance, the
earliest printers always bound the books they produced.</p>

Petrus filius Toraldi and Adam filius Hugonis Ruffi about land
in the parish of St. Mary the Virgin:—Robert, illuminator; Simon,

<p class='c037'>1264–84. William de Pikerynge, bookbinder, (“laminator”), died before
1308: found both in St. Mary’s and St. Peter’s deeds: probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the same as William the bookbinder of Oxford, the motto on

Little’s <cite>Grey Friars in Oxford</cite>, 1892, pp. 165–6).</p>

<p class='c037'>1340/1, Feb. Adam, bookbinder, occurs incidentally as holding a tenement
in Schidyerd way (now Oriel St.), in the Bodleian Oxford charter
no. 125* (Turner’s Catal., p. 307). This tenement he left to the
altar of St. Thomas the Martyr in St. Mary the Virgin’s church in
1349 (Wood’s <cite>City</cite>, ed. A. Clark, ii. 22, from a copy of the will).</p>

singulos scriptores scholaribus in scriptorum officio servientes”
(<cite>Munimenta Academica</cite>, ed. Anstey, p. 150, cf. 176; Wood’s

decreed that no booksellers except the sworn stationers or
their deputies should sell any book exceeding half a mark in value.

same College library, are printed in the Oxford Historical Society’s
<cite>Collectanea</cite> volume, no. 1 (pp. 78–139) and 2 (pp. 457–62), where
also it is shown that Dorne, who was certainly “a Dutchman,”
and as such paid with others an alien tax at Oxford in 1524 (see
Rogers’s <cite>Oxford City Documents</cite>, Oxf. Hist. Soc. xviii, 1891,
p. 56, as Johan Thorn), may be the Johannes Dorn who printed
at Brunswick in 1507–9. An <cite>Opus Insolubilium</cite> printed by Treveris

Balthasar Churchyard, Douchman. Harry Renkens, Douchman.
All these pay taxes as Dorne above, in 1524, in the capacity of

ascertainable.</p>

<p class='c037'>1631. From the fine of £300 inflicted on the printer of the Wicked
Bible of this year a fount of Greek type was purchased by Laud

<p class='c001'>[The following discussion of the authorship of the <cite>Praise of Music</cite>
(1586, no. 10) is referred to on p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a> as occurring in Appendix C, and
is therefore here inserted.]</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h3 class='c008'><cite>The Praise of Music</cite> (1586).</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This work is probably not by John Case, although constantly attributed
to him. The facts of the matter may be stated as follows.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book is strictly anonymous: all that can be gathered directly
from it is that the author was himself an enthusiastic musician,
though not necessarily of eminence; that he was a well-read scholar,
as well in the Fathers as in the Classics, and that his style and
method point to a man of imaginative mind, young in years, and with
considerable elegance of thought and expression. The printer writes
a dedication to Sir Walter Raleigh, alluding to the book as “an Orphan
of one of Lady Musickes children.” This can only be meant to convey
the impression that the author was dead: on the other hand the treatise
can only have been composed recently from the allusions to the controversy
about Church music: in fact the author was undoubtedly
a Protestant in Elizabeth’s reign, who approved of elaborate music in
Churches, within certain common-sense limits.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1588 John Case published at Oxford an “Apologia Musices”
written in Latin, and maintaining nearly the same view about Church
music as the book before us, to which Case makes no allusion. Case was
elected scholar of St. John’s College, Oxford, in 1564; and in 1568 fellow.
“But so it was,” says Wood (<cite>Ath. Ox.</cite>, ed. Bliss, i. 685), “that being
Popishly affected he left his fellowship and married [in 1574] and ...
read logic and philosophy to young men (mostly of the R. C. religion) in
a private house in St. Mary Magd. parish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The external evidence about the authorship in question may be put
as follows. In favour of Case is the important fact that Thomas Watson
the poet in a sonnet to Case does certainly seem to allude to the English
as well as the Latin treatise. Most of the expressions may, and more
than one must, apply to the <cite>Apologia</cite>, but the allusion to Marsyas can
only refer to the “Praise,” which indeed is mentioned by name, “Mr.
John Case ... his learned booke lately made in the prayes of Musick.”
Again, the fact that the <cite>Apologia</cite> nowhere alludes to the former poem is
itself an argument that they were not independent of each other, while
supposing that Case was partly ashamed of so light and poetical a production
and desired to be judged rather by a more philosophical work,
such as the Latin treatise, we can understand a desire to ignore the
former. To this may be added that such considerations as the above
were sufficient to convince critics like Dr. Farmer, Mr. Joseph Haslewood
and Dr. Bliss, as well as almost all others who have considered the
point. Against such a conclusion the following points may be urged.
Antony à Wood, who wrote lives of all Oxford writers up to his own
time, and who was born in 1632, will not even suggest that Case was the
author, but on the contrary declares that in all his searches he could
never discover who wrote the book. Richard Heber seems also to
have argued against Case’s connexion. With respect to Watson’s testimony
it must be remembered that he had left the University some years
before either book was published, and that it is quite possible that he
wrote his sonnet with both books before him and with little on which
to form a judgment except an obvious similarity of subject and point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>view. Some catalogues are said to have credited the printer with the
authorship, and Lowndes ascribes it to Barnaby Barnes!</p>

<p class='c001'>The internal evidence is against the common authorship of the two
books. The style of E.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> is light, poetical and imaginative, with numerous
digressions, apologized for and repeated: that of L. is more staid and so
to speak scholastic; the sentences and thoughts fall into a logical form
which are natural to Case. The latter passes by the mythological part of
the history of Music, the former finds it in accordance with his taste.
Both authors are learned: in E. the references to the Fathers are as numerous
as those from any other source: in L. the references to secular authors
predominate. Both draw from common sources, such as the <cite>Theatrum
vitae humanae</cite> of Beyerlinck and the classical authors: but in the longest
quotation common to both, one from Ornithoparchus’s <cite>Micrologus</cite>
(E. pp. 39–40: L. pref.), a treatise on singing and music (afterwards, in
1609, translated into English), in which the imaginary descent of Concentus
and Accentus from Sonus is given, they differ materially in one
point of the account: nor are the explanations of the kinds and effects of
the Greek styles of music entirely in accord. So too there are expressions
peculiar to each book which could hardly have been absent from the
other, had the authors been the same person (as in E. allusions to
Mercury’s three parts of music; the Roman college of minstrels; three
causes of music, pleasure, grief and enthusiasm: in L. to inanimate
nature moved by music, Homer as a minstrel, the idea that strings from
wolves’ and sheep’s guts would not harmonize together, bees not having ears,
modern musicians). But lastly the personality of the authors is different.
Both indeed take up the same general point of view, that music is lawful
in a Church, and both entirely neglect the <i>science</i> of music though they
profess to be ardent musicians: but in E. there is a distinct purpose to
oppose the attempt to exclude all mixed and “exquisite” music from the
public services: the author writes to his equals for the purpose of interesting
and convincing them: in L. we see the dialectician addressing those
trained in the schools and accustomed to the subtle distinctions and
formalities of scholastic logic, and also the teacher of youth, indulging in
moral and didactic reflexions (pp. 53–55). Once more, Case, according
to Wood, was known before 1574 to have proclivities towards the Roman
Catholic religion, and accordingly in L. we find no word of blame
addressed to that Church, the nearest approach being a note of triumph
over the defeat of the Armada on the last page. Could he then have
written, as the author of E., the following expressions, all used in contempt,
“in the time of popery” (p. 129), “popish church Musicke”
(ibid.), “the hypocriticall Monkes and Friers sang their seuen canonicall
houres” (p. 133), “rotten rythmes of popery and superstitious inuocation
or praying vnto Saints doth not giue greater cause of vomit to any man
than to my selfe” (p. 136)?</p>

<p class='c001'>The author of the “Praise of Musicke” may one day be discovered,
but he will probably be found to be some other than Dr. John Case.</p>

<h4 class='c036'>II. <i>Woodcuts.</i></h4>

<p class='c019'>These are 142 in number (not counting <i>plain</i> woodcut capitals), of
which 32 were used by Barnes. Most of these passed on to his successors,
who augmented them. In 1627 the two University printers
printed separately, and John Lichfield took the larger number for himself,
a few being used in common. It would be idle to print a complete list
of these, but the writer has full notes of the occurrence of all that are
found in each book. Twelve are alphabets, fifteen frames within which
any capital could be placed, and four are arched borders.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>B. <i>Type.</i></h3>

<p class='c019'>The following table exhibits the use made of different type by Oxford
printers 1585–1640, but applies only to the chief type of the body of the
work. Thus Pica Greek is the chief type of a book in 1591 at earliest,
but it is found occasionally in 1587, and Long Primer Greek in 1585.
So too Great Primer Greek is used in 1624, 9. And Hebrew type is
used sporadically from 1596 on (Long Primer, Pica and English, pointed
and unpointed: see 1596, 8 &amp; 9; 1601, 2; 1602, 3; &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c001'>The old measures make the type of all these very slightly smaller
than the above measurements.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>C. <i>Notanda.</i></h3>

<p class='c019'>It is curious to observe the small points which break the smooth
course of ordinary printing in these earlier times, some of them marking
progress, some a perturbation in the office, some stupidity. The following
are random notes of some bibliographical interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The change of use in the case of <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> (<i>Vniuersity</i> being the old spelling, and
<i>University</i> the new) may be remarked in progress in 1589, no. 5, and is practically
completed by 1610. But a capital U is not found at all in the period dealt with, its
place being in a few cases supplied by a large lower-case u.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. For “at Oxford” the common Latin is <i>Oxoniæ</i>, but <i>Oxonii</i> occurs sporadically.
<i>Bellositi Dobunorum</i> occurs in 1628: and <i>Rhydychen</i> (in Welsh books) in 1595, 1600.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. In 1588 (no. 8) we first find an Oxford <i>édition de luxe</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. The state of the office is shown by 1595, no. 4 (small stock of type); 1601,
no. 2 (Hebrew words sometimes transliterated, sometimes in Hebrew type: yet in
1603, no. 2, there is a complaint of the want of Hebrew type!); 1625, no. 16 (one
sheet in different type); 1628, no. 16 (carelessness).</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Red ink is found in 14<span class='fraction'>79<br /><span class='ov'>80</span></span>, 1628, 1631, 1633 and thereafter; and gold-printing in
1633.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. Curiosities of workmanship will be found in 1629, no. 14; 1631, nos. 10, 17;
1633, nos. 26, 33; 1634, no. 9; 1635, no. 3; 1636, no. 15 (signatures); 1638, nos. 3,
17 (do.); 1640, no. 24: and eccentricity on the author’s part in 1631, no. 29; 1633,
no. 9 (phonetic spelling); 1635, no. 10. In 1613 no. 29 (Rainolds) on the first two
pages of each section the headline is “prophecy”, but on every other page it is “prophecie”.
1634 no. 17 (Statuta) is a true folio, in every sense in which the word is used.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. The number of books or editions issued at Oxford is roughly as follows:—15th
cent., 15: early 16th cent., 7: 1585–1600, 125: 1601–1620, 230: 1621–1640, 370:
total, about 750. In the 17th cent. about 2700 were issued: in the 18th, about 2100:
in the first three quarters of the 19th, about 6500. The number from “1468” to 1900
may be estimated as likely to be about 16000.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. Of the Oxford books issued from “1468” to 1640, the British Museum contains
less than 70 per cent., and the Bodleian about 80 per cent. The following calculation
is not far from the truth:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The following tables and lists explain themselves. They give a detailed
picture of the mutual relations of Oxford and London printers and
publishers, and the development of the Oxford book trade. It will be
noticed how the archaisms (<i>Imprinted at Oxford by</i>, or <i>At Oxford,
printed by</i>, &amp;c.) are gradually worn off, with the rhetorical descriptions
(such as <i>celeberrimæ Academiæ typographus</i>), and the use of colophons.</p>

<p class='c001'>In some cases we find fictitious imprints, as in 1602, nos. 5, 11, 1611
(see impr. 7<i>a</i>), 1612 (impr. 7), 1613 (impr. 32), 1616 (impr. 35), 1626
(impr. 67). The number of books with no printer’s or publisher’s name
is small (see impr. 107, and Appendix, p. 151 (Stanley)), and of <i>books</i> with
no imprint at all there are very few instances, see 1586, 12; 1602, 8 and
9; 1603, 5; 1606, 5; 1622, 6; 1625, 9; 1635, 13.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the list which follows the spelling is modernized, the form alone is
exact.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
